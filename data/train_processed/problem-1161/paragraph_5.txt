I suspect the Czars think that invading (again) in the winter would mean that they are not stuck using roads and lining up a 50km long A10 Hog pilots wet dream. Czar Putin made the mistake of waiting until Emperor Jinping gave him permission to invade - the Emperor did not want his Olympics disturbed. That was the price to pay. Emperor Jinping only agreed to supporting Czar Putin's invasion on the condition Russia also supported glorious China's invasion of Taiwan which was scheduled but cancelled. Waiting for the Olympics to conclude meant the Czars army would have to use roads and get slaughtered.
