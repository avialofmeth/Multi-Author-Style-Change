Lol who? You think that wet blanket desantis has a better chance of getting the nom than Trump? Republicans aren’t taking full power again unless they fully restructure and somehow get out from under Trump and MAGAs hold, and that doesn’t appear to be happening ANYTIME soon. So, again, sucks to be in Indiana, but I’m not, and for good reason.
