Ukraine blocked off water to Crimea as soon as Russia occupied it back in 2014, and it remained that way until March 2022 when the Russian's got control over the Dnieper river. They would block access to water because Crimea does get a lot of its drinking water from the Dnieper, it's more pressure, but this is something that Russia has dealt with in the past.
