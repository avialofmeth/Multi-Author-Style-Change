Just happened to be referencing a senate voting record from 2001 earlier this evening and was kind of surprised to see at the time both N. Dakota senators were democrats, both senators from Colorado were republicans. I must be getting old because sometimes 2001 doesn’t seem that long ago, yet so much has changed and shifted. I was just a kid in middle school back then so maybe I just wasn’t paying attention, but the political tension in this country has become so extreme. Looking back through the fog of memory, pre and post 9/11 feel like completely different existences. anyway… close rambling tangent….
