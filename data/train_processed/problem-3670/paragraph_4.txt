Yes but I am just saying that I would be fine with it. Finland would be protected by NATO and Sweden would be Switzerland 2.0, that is surrounded by NATO countries. Someone would even need to conduct a sea or air invasion to get to Sweden (even a sea invasion may not be possible considering that Estonia and Finland could practically close the petersburg entrance into the Baltic Sea).
