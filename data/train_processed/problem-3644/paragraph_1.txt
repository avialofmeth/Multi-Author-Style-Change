Funny enough they have the same strategic role in the game Terra Invicta, haha. Small, mostly insignificant nations that are fairly useful / dangerous b/c you (or any other org) could take them over to launch a single strategic nuclear strike. With a level of plausible deniability, and w/out starting WW3, or any serious escalation / damage between the world's true major powers, which you might actually care about. Israel or North Korea might get nuked / invaded in response to nuking, say, Texas, but the damage would basically more or less end there.
