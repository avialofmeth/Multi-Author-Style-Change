I'm second gen American and one side of my family is from what was once Galicia in the border region of Poland and Ukraine. Since borders fluctuated so much in that area in the last century, my family says we're "Polish-Ukrainian." I am so proud of my ancestral countries and how Poland has supported its neighbor Ukraine. Both know all too well about neighboring powers invading for natural resources, etc.
