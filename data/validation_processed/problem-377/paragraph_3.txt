1) Russia is not losing, retreating to save military personnel is not losing unless you do it on your own ground (you don't treat annexed territories as Russian territories, do you?), or suffer heavy casualties. It is a stalemate situation for now, neither side is winning by now. (Germany wasn't really losing WW2 until 1943, when they suffered a major defeat in the battle of Kursk, though USSR was counterattacking since the beginning of 1942. Cities changed hands up to 6 times in that counteroffensive. So what is happening now is nothing but a swing of a pendulum of war, and considering the slowdown of Ukranian forces, the pendulum is about to swing in the other direction).
