The funniest part to me is how Republicans would literally be tripping over themselves in a heartbeat to nominate this Dr. Dre as their presidential candidate if he came out as conservative in the middle of a string of incidents where he said some very offensive, politically incorrect things. They would become so obnoxious overnight about blasting his music from every diesel-guzzling vehicle in the country, shrieking about how he's a real doctor and Jill Biden is an imposter, etc. (Not that The Chronic wouldn't be a welcome improvement on its own over their current choices.).
