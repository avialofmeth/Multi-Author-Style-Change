that's one aspect but look at what the gop has been doing with electioneering shenanigan for the last decade. closing down polling places, not enough voter counters, changing the laws for 'security reasons' that add all sorts of needless speedbumps. they're trying all the bullshit they can to disenfranchise voters they dont like within the existing laws. they created this beast and now they are unhappy with their actions.
