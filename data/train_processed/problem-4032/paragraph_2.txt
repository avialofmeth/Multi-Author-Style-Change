I am most certainly not one to toot the CCP's horn, but they are well aware of the oncoming climate crisis and appear to be working to mitigate it. Xi Jinping's speech at the latest congress had a section devoted to improving the climate and creating a society where people could live sustainably in harmony with nature -- the feel is very much that they're aware that a climate crisis would create unrest, so they want to get on top of it.
