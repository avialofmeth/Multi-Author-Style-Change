The treaty of Versailles was appropriate given the circumstances. And it really did weaken the hell out of Germany. The Germans had to cut all sorts of corners and hurry like hell and take on unsustainable levels of debt just to get to where they were in 1939. Just a few years earlier, Germany was weak, so weak that they wouldn't have been able to stand up against even their smaller neighbors. War should have came even earlier, then - the French had the grounds to invade Germany in 1936 when the Nazis reoccupied the Rhineland unilaterally. The French were utterly crippled mentally by WWI - but their military was on paper basically the strongest in Europe at the time, and while it had imperfections, the German army of 1936 was so much weaker than it was in 1939/40, to the point where the French army with all its imperfections could have completely crushed the German forces and done regime change.
