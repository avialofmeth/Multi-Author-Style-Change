Beware of the wishfull thinking. The fact that belarus is shit, or that people there could revel, or that russia could be weak and not able to atack from belarus could be true, but right now it is wishfull thinking. The only safe behavior in this situaion is to arm Ukraine wih atacms and heavy weapons as soon as possible and prepare for an attack from belarus, even if many people or experts consider it low chance. We cannot afford fail in here and have to be prepared for the worst esceranio. Even if in the end belraus doenst attack, the situation if there is an attack would be serious enough as to consider some kind of comments laughting at this posibility as russian trolls.
