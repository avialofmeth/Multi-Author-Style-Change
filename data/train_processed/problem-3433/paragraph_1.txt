Dem politicians are all pissed because they can't use the portal they had to tell Twitter which people and/or posts they want deleted. Now they are bitching about hate speech when way over half comes from the left. But, hate speech by the left has always been acceptable. Maxine Waters told people to gather a crowd and chase Republicans out of businesses. Most Dems including Kamala Harris, contributed to funds 3 years ago to bail out ANTIFA and other protestors so they could get back out on the street to loot and burn more businesses. Kathy Griffin posing with a wax Trump severed head and saying "I wish". Madonna talking about blowing up the White House with Trump in it. Johnny Depp saying "It has been too long since an actor killed a president". But because it is the left it is ok because they are on the "right side".
