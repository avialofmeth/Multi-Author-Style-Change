Yup, he inexplicably dropped out even though Congress signaled that a majority of them didn’t believe the rumors, which means it was true or there was more to be found. I think that’s what happened w/Al Franken tbh, it was a complete set up (chick in the photo is Hannity’s friend) but I had to wonder if there was more. He was in show business. Or something he didn’t want his wife to know. IMHO.
