Nah, drag is entirely an expression of self and joy. What you're talking about is performative morally fueled fascism. It's people getting placated for not wanting to accept that other people do not want to live like them or adhere to the same senses of morally restrictive standard as them. In a country where it's been made legally and constitutionally clear that they don't have a right to expect that privilege. It's a disgusting display of dominance by people so fragile they can't just do their own thing. If another person is living well doing something that hurts nobody but defies my own beliefs, they deserve to be restricted or eliminated. It's not a performance for enough of them that it's goofy as fuck to equate the two.
