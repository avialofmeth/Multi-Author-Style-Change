However, I believe universities should be as cheap as possible, I believe information should be free to be shared as a collective instead of being hidden behind a stupid amount paywalls. I believe we should have social security nets to help people who fall onto hard times, god knows I sure did. I’m an atheist and I think religion should be completely fucked off from legal everything, religion should not play a part in laws ever (ironic considering the “god knows” last sentence). I believe abortion should be completely legal up until a point and after that point have progressively more restrictions placed on it, I do not believe “I changed my mind” is a valid reason for a third trimester abortion. I believe that if you’re gay and like dick then fucking go for it, same for lesbians, idgaf unless you’re sexually harassing me, but then the issue is the harassment not the being gay. If you’re trans same shit, I mean why the fuck would I care? I don’t plan on dating a trans person, the though makes me feel weird but fuck I’ll call you Alyssa if you really want me to idgaf. I’m all for reducing pollution from litter and plastics. I think there should be some restrictions to the economic ecosystem to stop monopolisation and price gouging. I believe in science. I believe the process of legal immigration is pretty shit and needs reworking. I believe the legal system needs a bit of a reform and that police should be trained for longer and be subject to yearly audits to ensure they’re conducting themselves properly. My mother is black, I’m mixed so obviously I’ve not got any dumb racist opinions, be kinda counterintuitive to hate myself for my race instead of the slew of other reasons I could hate myself.
