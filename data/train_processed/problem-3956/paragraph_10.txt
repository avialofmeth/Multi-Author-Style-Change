Iran's very good at evading sanctions. They're still flying F-4 Phantoms and F-14 Tomcats 44 years after sanctions were implemented. It would be tough to replace any of the modern electronics in the SU-35s but the parts most likely to fail are wear and tear components. Iran can procure those directly from Russia or manufacture them themselves.
