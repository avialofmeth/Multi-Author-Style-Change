I honestly don't know what the Chinese government thinks anymore. I can agree that what you're saying is generally the vibe I get from them, and it's also true that fascist governments do typically think and behave irrationally, but I don't know just how much of a break Xi Jinping is from previous administrations. You would hardly have expected this kind of thing from Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao, and the idea that a weird fascist authoritarian whose only conception of foreign policy is grandstanding could climb his way up a bureaucracy like the CCP is kinda mindblowing to me.
