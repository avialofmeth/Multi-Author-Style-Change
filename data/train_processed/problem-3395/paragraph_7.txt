What i dont get is why they wouldn't make a run for kiev itself. If kiev itself fell then the ukrainians organized resistance is for the most part kaput. From belarus to kiev seems like an easier approach than from crimea/donbass/Donetsk to kherson. Trading possession of the rubble filled eastern cities again doesn't guarantee the ukrainians wont take it back anyway. Like when america invaded iraq. Baghdad or bust take the capital and let your enemy deal with no leadership.
