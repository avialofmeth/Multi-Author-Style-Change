you're right, but I personally find it unhelpful when professions manufacture jargon for simple concepts. "Group attack" would have been fine for their internal usage and less confusing for external audience. I suppose confusing the external audience is intentional as it helps trip-up a lot of potential criticism on semantics alone.
