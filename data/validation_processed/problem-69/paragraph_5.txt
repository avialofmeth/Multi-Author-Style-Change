Ashli Babbitt died committing an act of domestic terrorism. She attempted to leap over a barricade to attack sitting members of Congress and embolden others to follow her over the barricade. What's worse is she served in the Air Force and turned her back her oath. She was mortally wounded by a federal agent in response to her actions in order to protect law makers from terrorists.
