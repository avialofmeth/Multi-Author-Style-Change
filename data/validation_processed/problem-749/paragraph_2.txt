It’s amazing how you can mention “human rights abuses” and the Afghan war in the same sentence an not have those connected. Home boy you were committing war crimes in Afghanistan in those 20 years. 95% civilian casualties in thousands of drone strikes. Brought pedophiles into the government there. Bush, Obama and Biden have been the most destabilizing administrations the world has seen since WW2.
