With Turkey joining NATO in 1947, Russia has been forced to maintain this fleet. One might say even since the signing of the treaty of Montreux in '36, continually forcing manpower and material away from the Pacific and Baltic fleet. I agree that it has proven mostly irrelevant in the Ukrainian conflict, but that is mostly because its not built around it.
