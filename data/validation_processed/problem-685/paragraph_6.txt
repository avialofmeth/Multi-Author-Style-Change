I mean I can definitely see that happen, but I can't see India jumping off the rope they've been walking on. They're tiptoeing as it is, I highly doubt they'll make it this obvious. Plus, after what's happened with Russia, India wouldn't wanna risk it so soon. India still hasn't gotten a share out of China's pie in manufacturing, they're making strides. It would just mess the situation up far more imo.
