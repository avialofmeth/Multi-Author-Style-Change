If you think what a hypothetical super intelligence would do, it would manufacture weapons at a rate people couldn't keep up with. You can zoom out and visualize war and two clashing streams of energy. The force of one stream has to exceed another. Tanks, planes, and bombs flowing into ukraine from their own manufacturing facilities and allies has to exceed the tanks, planes, and bombs flowing into ukraine from russia. you can't force russia to stop, they can keep attacking for as long as they are humanly capable, but you can push back their energy.
