People can choose to move into the centers with friends or family member who are over 55 years old. They will on duty two days a week home care older people when hear bells ring for help. They will get the same services when they get old. Right now, government pay 25 dollars / hour and one to one service for low income people. The expenses can up to 300$ a day.

They can also work two hours in the garden every day for the organic food they need. They will have their own apartment, 700$ rent for a studio and 1100$ for one bedroomâ€¦.
