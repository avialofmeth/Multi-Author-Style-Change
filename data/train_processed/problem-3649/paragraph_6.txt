“Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the National Guard members who defend our state in Luhansk region as part of the defense forces. In particular, the soldiers of the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard, who, together with units of the Ground Forces, very effectively erase enemy equipment and the occupiers. Thank you, guys! We are doing everything so that you and all other soldiers have even more opportunities to chase the enemy,” Zelensky said.
