It sat at the lower end of Canadian firearms regulation as a non-restricted firearm and fires an intermediate round. Soft enough to not sore oneâ€™s shoulder but still powerful enough to take something down like deer reliably. Simple to use and the semi auto function allows for very rapid follow up shots if needed.
