That answer was laden with all the demographic nonsense. I went back to study some of it when I did some of my graduate work at Waseda. They've created a horrible self-perpetuating cycle; women are still encouraged out of the work force (Japan has the worst or near the worst rankings for gender equality among rich nations), men are still encouraged to be absent from their families for their work (making family life that much less appealing), living costs are high, elder care is essentially mostly a family matter (and thus marrying women are essentially signing on as future nannies to their husband's parents), etc. At the same time, many women are very keenly aware of all of this and are looking for better personal prospects, but that almost certainly means being single beyond what is considered ideal. Less marriage -.
