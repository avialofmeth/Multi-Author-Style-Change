Aren't you a little biased, though? Us Americans have been wasting our money on our military to defend Europe for decades. Why is it that we Americans have to live worse lives as a result of our money being sucked dry to defend Europe? Make no mistake, your life IS WORSE OFF as an American by spending almost a trillion dollars on our military annually. Ukraine isn't helping things.
