Because "they" the Amungme , Kamoro and other highlanders have NEVER practiced cannibalism unlike Americans like Antron Singleton and two dozen others I could mention. YOUR allegation that "they" have "cannibalistic beginnings" is PURE RACISM about indigenous nations & individuals about whom you are making up fantasy. Now if you or Michael Rockefeller want to sick your nose into Asmat territory asking if they would mind your family building a cargo harbour for exporting Papuan gold, copper and silver that your family wants to loot at Indonesian gunpoint; that's your choice just don't complain if they do decide to remove the colonial trouble maker they've got their hands on.
