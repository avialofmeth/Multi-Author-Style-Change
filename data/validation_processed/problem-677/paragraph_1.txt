I just dont get this perspective. We should be setting the example for the rest of society. I was happy to see other medical workers who refused the shot get canned, they made the rest of us look bad. How can ordinary citizens trust that it is safe if medical workers who should know best are refusing. that is to say nothing of the oath that many of us took to do no harm. If you are infected and spreading the infection you sure as shit are doing harm. This is also why for as long as I have been in the field have had to get a flu shot or not be able to go to work. Nobody threw a shitfit over that, and it was going on for decades. Hell I had to prove my vaccination status for all childhood diseases several times during training, and for good reason. Nobody wants to get measles from an asshole antivax doctor or nurse in addition to whatever you are there for. This is basic infection control, just like washing hands or contact precautions for c.diff. We should be held to a higher standard.
