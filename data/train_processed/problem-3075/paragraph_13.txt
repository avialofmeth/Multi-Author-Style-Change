Maybe I am being too optimistic, but having a bit of power but small margins might force the split people have been expecting. In opposition it is easy to be United and vote against stuff that is going to pass anyway. Itâ€™s different when it comes to impeachment or the debt ceiling. There will be consequences for fucking things up.
