Its disturbing that we are watching politicians take money from unfriendly sources and watching them turn around and do their bidding in shaping policy. Trump just repeated this week he doesn't trust our intelligence apparatus and believes Putins word over them. Its not a good look and his feet haven't been held to tbe fire over it.
