It's not important. It's not the point (and it's not exactly true but that's another thing). Israel tries to reason with the Palestinians 5 times already, even giving them complete control over almost all of the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem that Israel annexed. And they still refused, they don't care about that. They care about killing Israelis - more specifically? Jews.
