This is how I feel about the current case being heard by the SC about the website designer who doesn’t want to make websites for gay weddings.. if they want to discriminate, so can we. I already read about a restaurant that turned away a group because they’re a known anti-LGBTQ group, and they were flabbergasted, but hey. This street goes both ways motherfuckers. I’m looking forward to watching it fly back in their self righteous faces.
