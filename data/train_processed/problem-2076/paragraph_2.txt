The area where it happened is known for high rates of drug use as well as a lot of nutjobs who live off the grid in tents, shipping containers and self constructed tin structures - initial information suggests that the shooters (two brothers and one wife) had a heavy presence on Australian conspiracy theory websites and were hardcore anti-government sovereign citizen types who hated police. Being a rural area gun ownership is a lot more common as they have to deal with wild dogs, pigs, etc - police would have been aware of this but obviously weren't expecting to get ambushed by multiple shooters during what was a routine welfare check.
