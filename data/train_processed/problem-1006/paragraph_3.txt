Then there's the matter of who the Republican nominee is. If it's Trump, then Republicans are not in a good position. A scenario where Democrats manage to retake the House and keep the Senate isn't that farfetched but now it's way too early to guess how things are going to pan out. In fact, given the last few election cycles, I'm not sure anyone can know for sure what's going to go down. In 2016, exit polling showed that Hillary was the likely winner and in 2022, exit polling showed that Democrats were in trouble.
