Non of the right wingers thought the union is conservative tbf I mean they refuse to cooperate with the afd wich makes them unappealing to the more moderate right wingers. The only reason the union held on for so long was because of Merkel. she was one of the most solid uncontrovesial poleticians ever seen. So aslong as they are not rebranding more left or more right they are not gona win anything being a center party is no longer the way to win votes in the current year. Also I remember afd voters shouting down with the Merkel dictatorship.
