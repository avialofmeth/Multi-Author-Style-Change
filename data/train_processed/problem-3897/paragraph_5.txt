Conveniently leaving out the fact that all NPP operators refused multiple times in 2021/22 to restart or extend their plants because of the law that CDU/FDP signed in 2011. Following that, operators didnt buy any new fuel rods, kept maintenance to a minimum, didnt extend their supply chain contracts, licenses etc. The cost is too high, therefore even capitalists agree that renewables are the better investment for both short and long term. Greta doesnt seem to realise that money is finite and that it should be spent on the most efficient option (its not nuclear).
