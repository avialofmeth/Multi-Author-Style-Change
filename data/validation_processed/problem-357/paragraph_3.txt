My tinfoil hat theory about Sinema is that she was a Republican plant placed in the Democratic primaries tailor-made to lose the general elections by being too far "left" and "one of those people." Only, she failed by actually getting elected and has since made up for it by being a constant roadblock to Democrats. I fully expect her to lose her primary, attempt one last sabotage/fuck you by running as an Independent, and then spend the rest of her days running the conservative media circuit anytime they need a "former liberal" to shit talk Democrats, aka, the Tulsi Gabbard/Dave Rubin route.
