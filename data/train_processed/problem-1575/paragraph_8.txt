It's like coming along and saying “bro, your mom has stage 4 cancer, just write her off as dead and move on.” It's like a complete incapacity for empathy. And you're absolutely right when you bring the opioid epidemic into this, because it's just so broad and indiscriminate. Parents, children, friends, coworkers, white, black, it's not like there's a common thread among them other than the fact their blood is red. You can't write it off as a “Democrat-run city problem” or a “stupid rural hick problem,” it's everyone, everywhere, no matter your socioeconomic position. You can't otherize it without otherizing people in your own base.
