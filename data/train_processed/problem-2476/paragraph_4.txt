Tell me about it. On the plot where my house stands was a factory for artillery parts during WWII. Also, my town got visited by the US Air Force on a regular base during the war. The house only makes a small part of the plot, the rest I canâ€™t use for anything else but lawn because if I dug to deep chances are I either hit a big fucking piece of concrete from the factory or an aircraft bomb. This suck. -\_-.
