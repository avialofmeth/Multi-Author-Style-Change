A pogrom? Nah they were killing them all over. Burning them alive, there’s literally photos of It happening if you google search. Even the national all India radio was calling out anti Sikh slogans. Today they are still persecuted but you stay blind in your high mighty sand castle. India needs Sikh but want them as a bitch. It won’t happen.
