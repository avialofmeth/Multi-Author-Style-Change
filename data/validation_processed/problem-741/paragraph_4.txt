In contrast, 26% of the city's population of nearly 1 million people support the idea of reverting to Stalingrad, with 14% citing historical significance and 12% referencing the memory of the Great Patriotic War. Meanwhile, 21% of those who oppose the name change believe it would be expensive, 12% consider it pointless, and 11% think it is too focused on the past. Putin has stated that he would not object to the renaming if the residents of Volgograd support it. The 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad will be commemorated this week, and Putin is expected to visit the city.
