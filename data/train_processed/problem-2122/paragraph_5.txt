Doesn't negate the fact that allowing the Talis to do what they did while you had the weapons and equipment ready to rock shows me you were actually supporting their worldview for the women and children of Afghanistan or you were too much of a coward to step up for what was right. I have nothing but respect for the soldiers of the Panjshir Valley who stood their ground as a last stand of anti-Talis but alas, they were outnumbered and outgunned. True heroes in my opinion. The vast majority of the ANA and ANP ended up demonstrating they are nothing but contemptible cowards, which was the suspicion of the western trainers from the get-go.
