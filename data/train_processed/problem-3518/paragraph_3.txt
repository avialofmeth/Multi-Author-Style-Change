Maybe a decent way to try to understand this goes something like this: humans are tribalistic by nature, and some humans are especially susceptible to suggestion and to having strong reactions to identifying a “them”. To putting a name to a different “tribe”. Antisemitism is just one form of that process where a specific group of “them” is identified as a threat, or as different, or whatever their reasoning is.
