They have been promising self driving for like a decade. With it nowhere in sight, it's safe to say the hype is dead. No one is blown away by a car with no grille anymore. It'll be whoever actually gets self driving federally approved and in use by the public that wins. They had an R&D lead that simply evaporated when the low hanging fruit got picked, and every other manufacturer will simply out compete them now. Tesla needs a major breakthrough or they're done. Rivian is already on the market and is already becoming THE EV truck people think of. Tesla truck? Huh?
