Just because something is legal doesn't make it morally correct or fair either. The person you replied to wasn't talking about universities or hospitals. He's talking about multi billion revenue companies who have much more sway in politics due to their wealth than many voters combined, just consider how many politicians or political parties get paid by these companies to lobby for them. As an obvious example, look at the awful design of American cities and how it came to be that public transport is drastically underdeveloped in the US.
