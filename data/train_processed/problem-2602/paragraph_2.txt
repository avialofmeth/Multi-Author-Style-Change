So long as I can order a vial of "research" chemicals from China I can order fentanyl. This is a problem with how the US makes it so easy to buy such chemicals and import them. If the government had any balls, they'd just restrict such imports entirely except to accredited institutions and licensed pharmacists. It'd shove it all into an underground black market, but it's already a grey market and it can start a discussion about decriminalizing possession and focusing on distribution instead.
