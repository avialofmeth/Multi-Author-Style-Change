I'm in eastern Oregon, where the cool thing for sheriffs to do has been announce via Facebook that they will not enforce this "unconstitutional" law. Hence, anyone concerned their identity will hinder obtaining a firearm under this law should just enlist the assistance of one of our "constitutional sheriffs"!
