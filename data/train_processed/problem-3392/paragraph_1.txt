In a sense, it really is the same government. The first prime minister of modern Japan was one of the top guys in the imperial government, for a while he was in charge of Manchuria where some of Japan's worst crimes against humanity took place. He also formulated the plan to use civilians in Manchuria as slave labour to drive Japan's wartime industrial base. He staffed his government with a lot of convicted war criminals who were also higher up in the old government, who his administration let out of prison early.
