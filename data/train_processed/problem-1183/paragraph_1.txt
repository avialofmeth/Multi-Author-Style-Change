Yeah sorry for anyone sitting there hoping this was the start of WW3 but anything short of definitive proof that Russia deliberately targeted a fucking farm in Poland this wasn't ever going to go anywhere. Poland is going to invoke Article 4 (not 5) and probably end up getting a ton of missile defense systems as a result. That's it.
