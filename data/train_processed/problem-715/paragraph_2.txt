Yeah, Cmdr Walker, who sold the screw configuration of our submarines to the Soviets in the 1980s was paid like $30,000, and Clayton Lonetree, the US embassy guard in Moscow, sold us out for sex with a pretty average looking female KGB agent. I think treason should carry the death penalty, especially if you're compromising the entire submarine fleet for $30,000 or selling embassy secrets for a blowjob. This pilot should be shot too, if he's guilty.
