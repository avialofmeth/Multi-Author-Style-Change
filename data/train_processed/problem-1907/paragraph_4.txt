Commander of the Ukrainian forces Zaluzhnyi has announced that his goal for 2023 is the equipment of 10-20 new combined arms brigades, which would be about 40.000-100.000 men and some hundred tanks. This would require western equipment, unless Russia hands over another couple hundred operational tanks.
