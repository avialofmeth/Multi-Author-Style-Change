Hopefuly all the seized russia assets, including the half a billion dollars of bank assets, will go towards reparations for ukraine. It would actually be almost enough, I read estimates that ukraine will need 800-1000 billion dollars to recover from the war, and I REALLY hope that EU is not planning to pay it off by themselves. Russia will never agree to pay that, so we just have to take it.
