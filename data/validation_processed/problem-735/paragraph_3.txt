Wait so these big sprawling highway networks that we plowed under farmland for and build suburban one off housing all over the place using is stupidly expensive to keep maintaining? Well by all means, Iâ€™m sure since you pride your citizens on their civic pride they will surely pay tax by a largeish increase to property, and other local taxes. This is the question people, why are we not consolidating resources for important things like healthcare, childcare instead of expanding roads even further.
