Let's be real: this judge is from a county that's 10,000 square miles (larger than 6 US states) and holds 7500 people and 2 'cities' (the largest one being 3000 people). It's practically empty. If you fire off a gun with a high-capacity magazine out there you're just going to hit a bunch of cows and trees.
