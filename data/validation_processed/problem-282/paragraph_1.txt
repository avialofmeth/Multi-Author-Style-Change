Something like 90% of the time and money in the 2020 election was spent in the 11 or so swing states. GOP pres candidate isnt going to go to NY or CA. But if you had to split the electoral votes according to popular vote. Or it was just straight up popular vote. They would spend time there cause it would matter. If youre a conservative in CA or a progressive in WV how many of you aren't voting for Pres. because you know its useless? I think thats one of the reasons for low voter turn out in pres elections. Unless youre in those couple swing states youre vote for pres doesnt matter.
