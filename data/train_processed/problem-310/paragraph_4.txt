Gaetz is navigating the quagmire by trying to pass the ultimate purity test, by positioning himself as the farthest right in the chamber, and it is in large part working for him personally, at the expense of his own party, as well as our republic as a whole. A quick spin through Facebook comments confirms it, too. In recent days, I’ve seen nearly every consequential member of the GOP from both chambers called “RHINO” (sic), except Gaetz.
