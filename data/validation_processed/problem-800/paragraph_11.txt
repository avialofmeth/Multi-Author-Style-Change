LNG burns a lot cleaner than coal, but it takes a lot of energy to liquify gas to liquid form. Even worse, at all stages LNG tends to leak methane which is horrible for the environment. How much methane is leaked or flared is up for debate, but recent literature suggests it's significant enough to be a legitimate concern that expanding coal plants may actually be a more environmentally friendly solution to shipping LNG long distances.
