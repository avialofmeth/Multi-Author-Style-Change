Winter in an area that is mountainous while seeing an economic boom in construction past several years but accusations of safety standards being ignored in earthquake resistance. Erdogan is pushing hard to be seen in front of this but it looks bad. He's spent past several years kicking out NGOs so you don't have them on the ground like 99 earthquake. Plus his crackdown on civil society means groups are paralyzed without specific instruction. All of this is a toxic combination to then find a major earthquake aftermath facing you.
