The bottom line is that when you retire, you start to cost society more than you contribute. And many countries now have ageing populations. And again, that’s not to speak ill of anyone who is retired or insist that increasing the retirement age is a good thing or the best course. It’s just a difficult situation. This is also why immigrants are very good for a country, they buff the working age population, and help alleviate these stresses.
