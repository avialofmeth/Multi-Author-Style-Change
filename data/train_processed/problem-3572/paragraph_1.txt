We (collectively) have learned absolutely NOTHING from Trump. He lied constantly and the media covered it and we all shared it. Then came MTG and Boebert, and now this confirmed serial liar. We keep doing the same thing, sharing their obvious lies, mocking them in the comments section, and laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. They keep getting more press and attention. Now MTG is on a bunch of committees and sheâ€™s about as bright as a sack of rusty hammers. We have to start ignoring these people because media will keep covering them if we keep clicking and sharing.
