From what I understand these are aircraft Russia built to be sold. They’ve been trying to offload these for a while now. Iran is giving drones, drone components and support in Ukraine so this deal is likely a handshake for the support..so I doubt Russia will miss on delivery. The Su-35 is still a very capable aircraft and should not be underestimated in the hands of a good pilot. However, since these birds were built for sale they most likely don’t have the hardware and other things built into them that would compensate for having non experienced pilots. These aircraft with Iranian pilots won’t really make Iran any more capable than they already are.
