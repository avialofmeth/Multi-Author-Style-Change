Best case scenario is the DOJ was waiting on that and will attempt to combine all initial federal charges, including the GA case and the docs case, since the GA case has federal implications, too, and since they would likely need to coordinate indictment efforts for such a high profile subject so to not overstep each other. This is my hopium.
