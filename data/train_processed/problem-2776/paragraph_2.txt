Meh, builds character. I have a good friend who is in his thirties and he literally can't listen to opposing points of view. I tried to show him a 10 minute clip that I knew was contrary to point of view but I believe was a well reasoned counter point. He started shaking his head, his knee was vibrating and he only lasted about two minutes before he had to leave the room he was so upset.
