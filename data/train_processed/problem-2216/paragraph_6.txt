I had a lot of economics classes and my school was a “Keynesian” school. A teacher made a point of discussing how some schools taught neoclassical economics and how different the assumptions were. One of the things that confused the hell out of me was why neoclassical economics are even taught, despite the fact that they’re clearly based in politics and not reality. Which - makes no sense in education.
