Other countries have been bandied about, pretty much all of them NATO countries including the US. But while everyone is claiming it was sabotage, we haven't really seen any evidence in public that it was. Fragments of a detonating mechanism, or the bomb itself, etc. So we basically have to take the word of governments for it, and they may have some hidden incentives.
