this is a HORRIBLE idea. you're talking about taking away peoples' autonomy of thought. you're talking about enforcing a way of thinking on people which is as close to mind control as you can get. this would quite possibly be the most cruel thing to do to someone ever. like you could argue torture of the flesh is worse, but idk, something about losing control of your own mind just seems much more horrific. And this isnt even covering how I know with absolute certainty that if someone ever created an AI capable of doing what you described then someone will abuse it in a truly truly horrific manner.
