In response to your 3rd point, it’d a group effort and the US is the largest contributor. Sending a few tanks isn’t very helpful, but sending a big batch is. And I don’t know what went on behind the scenes, but maybe Germany said “send your tanks too or we won’t send any” to force the US to also send tanks (just maybe, not saying that’s what did happen).
