And I think that ratio goes a long way in explaining why the Russian death toll seems abnormally high for a post WWII conflict. The US suffering 91,000 killed in a post WII conflict would be absurd (that number is just under total US deaths in Korea+Vietnam) but if Russian soldiers are getting injured and then dying from wounds at much higher rates then it could drive their death toll while their total casualties isnâ€™t quite as high relatively speaking.
