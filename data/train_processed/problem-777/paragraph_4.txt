Dems not only need high voter turnout, they need their voters to not do split ticket voting in swing states.. if you are a Dem voter, this would be the worst possible time to do something like voting for Shapiro and Oz, or voting for Warnock and Kemp, or Kelly and Lake (sadly polls show many are leaning to vote that way).
