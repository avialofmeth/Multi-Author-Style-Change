Honestly thanks for this. I do pee in the shower often (I live alone, and I clean my shower constantly). Recently i've noticed urges to pee ALL the time i hear water and my bladder control seems really bad because im not using my pelvic floor muscles to hold it. When im out an about I have to find bathrooms way more often. So honestly, thanks for this. Good Doctor. I will stop peeing in the shower.
