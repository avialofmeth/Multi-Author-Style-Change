No I will not belittle this mans death so I can feel "happy". How about you appeal to your better nature and direct your scheufraud towards turds that got what deserved because they actually did something wrong or evil. Instead of someone just going to work to provide for his family. It would cost you nothing to not mock this mans death... Not a fucking thing. Fireman burns to death in fire ... what a fucking gutbuster.
