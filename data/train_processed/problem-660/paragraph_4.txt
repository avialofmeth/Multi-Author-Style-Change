So my theory is she has staff around her that are doing what happened to Hillary, trying to make her seem like a boring male candidate/politician, and not letting her be herself. When you see behind the scenes stuff and her around normal people, she's actually really likeable. I saw some cell phone footage of her doing the WH Trick or Treating event, and she seemed to legitimately be having a blast with the parents and kids--and they really liked her too. But the second she ends up on a debate stage or in a scripted interview, she just seems like the most basic, sterile, unlikeable every day politician imaginable.
