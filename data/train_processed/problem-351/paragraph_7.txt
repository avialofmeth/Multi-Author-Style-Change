Only ban certain guns and make it harder for people to get them not easier. Education on how that gun you are about to buy to protect your family is more likely to be used to kill a family member either thru suicide or accidental discharge than it will ever be used to protect anyone. Some people simply shouldnt have guns especually those who have no idea how to use them or a respect for what they can do.
