What’s ironic to me is - the same people who will defend the colossal expense of the arms race in the 80’s because it helped to defeat the soviets are opposing sending this relatively small amount to a country that’s basically being murdered by Russia. Meanwhile, it’s having the effect of putting a halt to most of the rest of Russia’s belligerent bullshit. Seems like we’re getting off cheap….
