Iâ€™m surprised the Norks managed to send drones all the way to Seoul and have them come back unscathed. Reckon a few heads will roll within the South Korean military over this. The relatively small size but long range of some drones appears to be causing some headaches for air defence commanders as we are also seeing in Ukraine-Russia.
