If there's much left of civilization in 100 years, they're gonna look back on this shit and use it as an example of how fucking stupid humans can be. I overheard an older man at a local grocery store ranting about how the cold snap we had here in the US was an indication of how BS the 'liberal climate agenda' was. I had the briefest urge to confront him, but about a decade of this has completely worn me down.
