Then I’d be more inclined to do a Substack, so the information is still available for free for those who can’t or won’t donate. I am a teacher, I am not sure how I would feel about having to segment off content or input for Patreon rewards. But yes, I agree Youtube could use a bit more spice in its "apolitical politics" space. On the one end of the spectrum you have flashy infographics shows like Kurzgesa that are corporatized, simplified and sanitized to the point where your average middle schooler could follow along easily, while on the other end of the spectrum you have channels like Perun that do three hour powerpoint presentations on Russian logistics attainment from 1997 to the present day. Highly recommend that channel if you are interested in the military side of the Ukraine War by the way. In any case, some more middle of the road content on a high school to college undergrad level might fill a niche. We’ve seen a lot of history channels fill a similar space the last five years, like Voices of the Past.
