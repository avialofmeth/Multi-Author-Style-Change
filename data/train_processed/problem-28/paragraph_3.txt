For those who aren’t keeping track, in addition to Wagner, the largest PMC with tens of thousands of mercs, there’s at least two other smaller mercenary groups confirmed to operate there, consisting of a mix of Russians, Syrians and Ossetians, allegedly on the payroll of a Russian minister and one of the oligarch-run megacorps. Furthermore the Russian Orthodox Church is believed to be funding a two thousand man volunteer force, the ROVS (basically the descendants of Civil War veterans who didn’t return to Russia after 1991) operate a foreign volunteer force associated with Igor Girkin, and Dimitry Rogozin is believed to operate an imperialist volunteer corps hoping to use the conquest of Ukraine as a springboard for the restoration of the Russian Empire.
