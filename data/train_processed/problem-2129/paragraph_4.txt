The 3 Appeals Court members hearing the case, all Republican nominees, 2 of them by Trump, saw right through this charade and called it a “side show”. The time has come for there to be consequences for Trump’s useful idiots who are responsible for who are egregiously waisting the court’s time to suffer consequences. If it’s within the bounds of this court, the lawyer perpetrating this sideshow should be forbidden to practice law before that appeals court circuit again.
