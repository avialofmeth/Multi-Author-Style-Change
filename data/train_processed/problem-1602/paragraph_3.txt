How to tell when "enough is enough" for Republicans: does the person in question have power, or provide a means by which power may be attained? If yes, then there is no bottom, absolutely nothing is off limits, power is all that matters. If no, then they need to be done away with ASAP because their stupid bullshit might prevent/stall/slow the acquisition of power.
