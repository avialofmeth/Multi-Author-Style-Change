I view the California Seismograph Live on youtube every night for a couple of minutes, and spotted the 7.8 followed by a 6.7. but I saw no representation on the actual drum, perhaps that is for local seismic and not from overseas areas. but the world map is shown with the larger dots. as well as reportings of them (depth, mag, time) then I searched earthquake and 30 minutes in was all over the YT news. you can also rewind its time window up to 12 hrs .
