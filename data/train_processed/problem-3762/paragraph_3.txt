I guess, but I suspect a lot of the libertarian candidate’s voters were probably people who voted for Kemp but couldn’t stomach voting for Walker but also didn’t want to vote Democrat. I suspect those voters will probably just stay home this time around since Kemp won and is no longer on the ballot.
