Neanderthals and modern humans are considered separate species by most scientists because of their physical differences (skull, body shape, all of which has distinct ranges for each species) as well as their differences in behaviour. Though there was some contact between modern humans and Neanderthals (as evident by the inbreeding) for the most part, both populations lived very separate lives, both with very different manners in which they lived (in terms of group size, dietary preferences, artifacts produced etc).
