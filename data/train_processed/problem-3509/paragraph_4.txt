This is a wrong interpretation of the ruling. The ruling is sentence for life, with no possibility of parole earlier than 15 years, but no guarantee for parole. The German constitutional court made clear that every incarcerated has the constitutional right for a chance to be set free within his lifetime as long as he meets the right conditions, and that is what the parole hearings are for (conditions like remorse, change in character and views, and so on).
