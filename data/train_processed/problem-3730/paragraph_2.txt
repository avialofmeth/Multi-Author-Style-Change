Lets be honest, shootings will only be allowed whin in danger OR there are no cameras present. If someone is shot, deny it. Then say Palestinians did it. Then say militarily needed, no matter the circumstance. And anyway, even if found guilty, worst is some community service and a smack on the wrist with a soft rag.
