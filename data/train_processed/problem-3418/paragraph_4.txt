Bold of you to assume they were teaching about any other Black Civil rights figures in the first place. I live in Illinois in a blue Chicago burbs county, and went to a top tier high school(...according to standardize testing results, anyways). We learned about MLK and Rosa Parks, nobody else, and even then it was a ton of revisionist history and ignoring the more controversial parts of their activism.
