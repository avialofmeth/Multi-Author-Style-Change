You disrupt the biggest football leagues in the world to host in Winter because your Summer is too hot to play! That should have been a non-starter from the get-go and raised huge red flags, but they'd already bought it so can't exactly give the money back. Plus the sheer madness of building what will be empty stadia at huge cost in lives and greenhouse emissions hosted in a backward country that doesn't acknowledge homosexuals exist and women should be seen and not heard. Madness.
