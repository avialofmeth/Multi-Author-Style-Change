There's one major change that screwed over their strategy.... they actually build nuclear weapons. In the past North Korea would threaten to start up its nuclear weapons program if the US/South Korea didn't capitulate to them and provide them with food. This food is provided via the UN as the vehicle and then every so many years there's population growth and the annual allotment that was agreed upon a few years back doesn't work anymore... so back to nuclear sabre rattling.
