The Republicans want a Russian-style kleptocracy, but I think they'd rather do without that inconvenient cross-Putin-and-die aspect. Putin's already demonstrated that, in a fight between Putin and oligarchs, the oligarchs lose badly. When your party leadership is chock-full of sociopaths, it's hard to be 100% sure that the oligarch you got elected doesn't turn into a Putin.
