And I suppose you think trump or anyone backed by trump is a competent fit for president? How do you reckon that despite the Jan 6 insurrection and stealing nuclear secrets? I'm all for a better democrat than Biden because he's old af and I don't really like him that much, but id vote for a puddle of doo doo water over anything remotely close to Trump.
