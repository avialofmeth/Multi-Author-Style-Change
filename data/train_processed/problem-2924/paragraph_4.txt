If Trump was to pick a woman for his VP running mate in 2024, I'd bet that he'd pick Lake over Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because he likely considers her 'hotter' and more 'high class' than Marge. Both women are despicably alike in their politics so the deciding factor for the Donald is likely to be on the shallow level of their looks.
