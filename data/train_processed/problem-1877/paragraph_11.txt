Heartwood Documentaries recorded this video about the connection between clearcut logging and the giant floods that wreaked havoc on the BC Interior. This was not just a historic rain event, it's a manmade disaster resulting from decades of clearcut logging in watersheds across the province. They used Google Earth Engine to zoom in on the forests around Merritt and Princeton, BC, two towns that have been evacuated due to flooding and are currently underwater. You'll be floored by the loss of forests over time. This is clearly a contributing factor to why these floods are so bad and I hope this story starts to be told.
