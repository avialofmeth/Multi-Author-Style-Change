Oh I don’t give a fuck you’re probably right they’re definitely richer than Putin since the west is addicted to their product and they can manipulate the prices quarterly to increase profits and cause politicians to lick their taint or face economic collapses in their respective countries. Definitely the house of Saud are the most powerful mfers on earth. Putin is the richest truck stop owner on earth, no comparison. Russian oligarchs flex that soft power buying condos in trump tower and Miami Beach, house of saud just own entire governing bodies, 1/3rd of Twitter and certain ex-presidents’ son-in-laws via 2 billion dollar investment firms.
