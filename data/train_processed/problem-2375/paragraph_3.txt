My country (Singapore) maintained a China-style lockdown policy until August 2021. When we reopened society, the COVID wave put pressure on hospitals but fortunately, the death rate was mitigated by near universal vaccination. China will face a similar wave when they reopen but with a subpar vaccine and low uptake among elderly, they will likely see mortality as high as America and Europe at the start of the pandemic.
