        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 uses a colon and a parenthesis, while Paragraph 2 uses ellipsis, period, and exclamation mark. Different punctuation styles indicate a lack of consistency in punctuation usage.",

    },
    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 uses formal language with words like 'removal' and 'questions,' while Paragraph 2 includes more informal and explicit language like 'fucking' and 'delusions.' The lexical and grammatical features differ significantly in formality and word choice.",

    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 maintains a neutral and somewhat informative tone, typical of bot responses. In contrast, Paragraph 2 conveys a highly opinionated and aggressive tone, not commonly found in bot-generated content. The narrative styles and tone are markedly dissimilar.",
