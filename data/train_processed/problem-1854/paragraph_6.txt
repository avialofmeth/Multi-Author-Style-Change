I don't know what's going to happen, but I think part of the Ukrainian playbook will be to strategically yield untenable positions and attempt to divert forces by threatening the land bridge to Crimea. The next big offensive push on the Ukrainian side may have to wait until they have the modern tanks, provided that they can keep the skies contested.
