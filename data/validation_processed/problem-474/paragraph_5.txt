Yep but also the fact that Trump hasn’t been charged in his case despite literally obstructing and lying about it is what makes this even worse. Obvious crimes were committed in Trump case but the lack of charges allows the right to essentially ignore it. Biden situation should have an investigation but in both cases they need to be very transparent and inform the public what they find and if they do find crimes in either case charge them. The public trust in the DOJ is at an all time low because we are onto their shit and realize they don’t have any interest in holding the ruling class accountable.
