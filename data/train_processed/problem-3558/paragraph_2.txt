There are different people in leadership, and also ordinary people in Ukraine have fundamentally changed their attitudes. It takes time, but the change was visible even visually already a year ago, when the cities and villages looked better: the roads were better, the infrastructure was better, children's playgrounds, city administration buildings and so much more were better: because bit by bit, attitudes have changed and people started demanding that their local governments function for the benefit of the people and if not, many corrupt officials have gotten voted out.
