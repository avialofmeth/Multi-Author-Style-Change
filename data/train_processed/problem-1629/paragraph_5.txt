The same is true of everything coming out of that global bloc. Large majorities of Iranian drones are being taken down, of course that is kind of the point of launching cheap waves but still. The Ukrainians (and the west in general) is discovering that having a robust gun based SHORAD is critical. The Gepard is a cost effective means to take out low flying and slow drones (guns instead of expensive missiles).
