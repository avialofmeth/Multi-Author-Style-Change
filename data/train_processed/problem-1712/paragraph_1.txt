Not looking forward to the Iron Harvest that will happen for decades after. There is a good reason most countries stopped using landmines. They rarely injure their targets and less so kill them. They more so usually maim farmers and kids, take a look at cambodia and vietnam. Kids constantly missing arms and legs.
