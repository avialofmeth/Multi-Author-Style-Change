The thing is, schoolyard, boxing ring, etc. is waaaayy different than the struggle of nations. Second place is, to put it mildly, unpleasant. All we have to do is look at what the Russians are doing in Ukraine now. Or in Poland and Germany in 1939 & 1945 respectively. Or the Japanese for decades. Or, or, or… Hell, the Assyrians were such violent evil assholes they still have a reputation thousands of years later. And they haven’t mattered in thousand of years. Think about that.
