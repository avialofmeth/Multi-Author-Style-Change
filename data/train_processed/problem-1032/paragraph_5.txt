Yeah, these steps could have prevented this situation with Southwest, but this letter was sent back in June, so it's not like Sanders could have predicted everything that happened in December. The fact that Buttigieg was warned the airlines were falling apart months ago and didn't do any of these suggestions or really anything else to improve the situation is why people are so pissed off at him.
