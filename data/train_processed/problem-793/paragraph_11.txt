It's a symbolic act yes but that doesn't Mena it is nothing. A big issue for lots of former colonies is the refusal of former colonial powers to even admit that they did harm. Acknowledgement is generally the first step for any potential repatriation. Recognizing that doesn't mean it's being treated as a some silver bullet to every ripple of harm produced from colonization.
