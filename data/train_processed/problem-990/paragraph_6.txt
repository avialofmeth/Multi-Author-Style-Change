No one would with high probability follow Putin's blessings, Shoigu WAS a top choice at one point, but that ship has sailed, another one is Medvedev but Putin has been transferring him all over the Kremlin that I believe he doesn't trust him either, but everything is so brainwashed, truth and reality are twisted and filled with conspiracies and suspicion in Russia that no one would actually believe that Putin gave a blessing to an opposing figure.
