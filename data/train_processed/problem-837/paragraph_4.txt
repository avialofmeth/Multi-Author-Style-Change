Thank you This should have made a much, much bigger impact and it shouldn't disappear into the Trump news hole. Durham's investigation did exactly what Trumpians claimed the Russia investigation did -- while proving the Russia investigation didn't do those things After an investigation that went on twice as long as the Russia investigation And it found evidence of ADDITIONAL TRUMP FINANCIAL CRIMES And Barr lied about the Durham investigation constantly!
