That was a weird read, as someone in the “The West”… because outside of articles that mostly Indian people post on subs like this… we rarely think or talk about India. If there’s a disaster or some big event, sure, and recently when India decided to stick with Russia, there’s some talk. Even then, it’s mostly in response to Indians, Hindutva brgades, and others using the “India is for India, stop criticizing our choices” articles.
