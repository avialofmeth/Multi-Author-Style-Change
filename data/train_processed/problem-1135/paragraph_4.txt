If you want to cite me the studies that show that magazine bans have any effect on mass shootings, Iâ€™d be more than happy to believe that. But, as it stands, no such data exists. Magazine swaps take me, a beginner shooter, 2.6 seconds to complete (last time I did magswap drills at the range.) Trying to limit magazine capacity is NOT going to lower body counts.
