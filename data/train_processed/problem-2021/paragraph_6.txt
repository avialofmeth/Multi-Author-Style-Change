My theory is that these stories are appealing to people because of confirmation bias. It's almost like people want to believe that the world is doomed to justify their preconceived notions about inevitable ecological collapse (which is far from a done deal). Stories about solutions or recovered ecosystems don't fit that template. Plus, they're typically a lot less dramatic and interesting than a catastrophe is.
