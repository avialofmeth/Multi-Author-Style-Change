Edit for info: in the UK, was 13 at the time, teacher told us we were about to start studying WWII, boy said he had a bomb from WWII could he bring it in, teacher said yes , was quite happy about it. Next history lesson, Boy brought the bomb in on the bus, the teacher said he had something else planned for that lesson. Bomb went in the kids locker till later in the week. Teacher had something else planned again but the boy couldn't put the bomb back in his locker as he needed the space for his P.E. kit. So the teacher took it to store for him, ended up using it as a door stop for a few days, before we finally had a lesson on it. When asked where he got it from, he told us he found it farming over the summer. Bomb squad got called, they put it in a tiny metal igloo and set it off . Also the teachers name was Mr. Plows.
