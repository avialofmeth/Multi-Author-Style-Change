The engine exhaust seems to come out of a tube bolted to the cylinder heads. All you do is bolt on a tuned pipe which is a very classic way to improve engine performance, and one that Russia is quite capable of making. The tuned pipe will give you a high pressure region from which you can side tap some exhaust gas to pipe back into the airframe with a flexible silicone tube. It is not uncommon to use silicone tubing to divert engine exhaust away from a RC plane to keep engine goo off of the sides. It is also common practice to side tap gas from an exhaust system to pressurize liquid fuel from a fuel tank into an engine.
