You’re not playing the same game they are. Santos is a HUGE asset to the GOP. He’s a distraction, a lightning rod, a smokescreen. His entire purpose is to draw fire and ye gods and little fishes is he doing a good job of that. They’ve given him committee assignments, for fucks sake. They get everything they want with him and they get to act like they can’t do anything about him.
