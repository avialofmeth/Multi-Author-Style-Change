Then in 1957 this guy Duvalier took over as dictator and ruled with the help of his personal death squad known as the Tonton Macoute running around raping and killing folks. He created a cult of personality portraying himself as a vodou witchdoctor with supernatural powers. He made himself President-for-life but had American support because he hated communists. His son succeeded him as president but was overthrown. There was an interim government, some more military coups, Aristide and then more coups. Then there was no more military so the military became gangsters and waged war against the government. And now it's happening again, this time with the police becoming gangsters.
