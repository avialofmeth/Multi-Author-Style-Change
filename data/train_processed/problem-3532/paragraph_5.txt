I don't understand your reasoning. Even Zelenskyy wants to talk to Xi. There's no disadvantage in trying to get China to do the right thing? I think the whole "Hope for the best, expect / prepare for the worst" makes sense as you can show your own populace that you're trying for a peaceful solution. This could weaken the arguments of those idiots that are still against sending weapons.
