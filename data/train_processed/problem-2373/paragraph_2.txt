It blows me away when I read about people thinking that Russia can sustain this. They can't. No one can. Sacrificing an entire battalions worth of people per every city block is not a sustainable amount of attrition. There is a LOOOOOOOOOOT of Ukraine left for Russia to take before this even gets close to over.
