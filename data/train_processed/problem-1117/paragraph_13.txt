There’s a big difference between top tier units and VDV, whose reputation seems to overshadow their abilities. I’m surprised they were tasked with such a critical objective. Even special units like GRU has are filled out by conscripts. I wonder to what extent fully professional units like Alpha have participated in operations, but they are more counter terror than direct action.
