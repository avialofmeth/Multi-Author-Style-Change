You dont get it. All important people who make decisions live in Moscow, and they are not willing to risk getting blown up. It is other Russians who can be blowed up without consequences. Common Russians dont matter. Bridge does not matter. However life threat to themselves is unacceptable. So they would have to make sure Ukraine wont repeat something like that. And the only thing which has not been used yet is nukes. If they just launch missile strikes again, Ukraine would just shrug (it has been done many times already, so who cares) and keep bombing Moscow. So they would nuke something at Ukraine and say "thats what will happen to all your cities if you dont stop".
