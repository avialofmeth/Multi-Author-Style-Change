I live in Southern Oregon and we get some terrible wildfires here too. When they are really close and really big, it looks like Modor outside. The sky is dark at noon, smoke gets in everywhere, there is an orange glow at night and burning embers fall from the sky. Most mornings you wake up and your car looks like it snowed but its a thick layer of ash.
