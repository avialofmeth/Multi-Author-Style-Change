Well, a bunch of election denier Republicans are running in these midterms, lots of whom are competitive, and not just in red states either. So it’s safe to say that the GOP learned the lesson that they can openly run candidates that don’t believe in democracy (unless they win, of course), and people just… won’t really push back against that in any meaningful way. So that’ll just be the GOP’s MO from now on.
