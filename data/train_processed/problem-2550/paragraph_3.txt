But that's a win for the EU and Ukraine. Russia issuing passports in Crimea in the name of another land is admitting that they don't have the authority to issue passports in Crimea's name. This is not a "sanction" against Russia, but rather the EU saying "I don't think you own Crimea, so this passport you issued in a foreign Ukrainian city doesn't make any more sense to me than if you said it was done in Barcelona or Berlin".
