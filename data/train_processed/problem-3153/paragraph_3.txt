You might be surprised to hear that life has gone on as normal in many ways since last year's events. Not gonna defend the Taliban of course but it's a bit of a relief that Afghanistan hasn't turned into a totalitarian hellhole overnight like North Korea, or Iran in '79. Instead it's been more like loose restrictions here and there instead of a Stalin-like situation.
