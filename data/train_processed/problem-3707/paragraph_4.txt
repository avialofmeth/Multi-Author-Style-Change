They're exclusively targeting Chinese nationals in Canada, which is still disgusting (and I don't trust at all that the CCP is not using it to target dissidents abroad), but not the same thing. Not to mention lots of Canadians complain about Chinese businessmen who have gotten rich through illegal activities moving to Canada.
