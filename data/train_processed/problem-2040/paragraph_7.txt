After WW2: Second Yugoslavia is formed as federation of independent nations. Tito says something like: "You Serbs are nothing but trouble. Best we try to keep you away from causing ethnic tensions." Kosovo is granted status of "autonomous province" and its borders are formally established. With later changes in the constitution Kosovo was de facto a republic with its own institutions and Albanian as official language.
