Problem building their identity just like in most of the Europeans countries. Born and raised in Europe, 4th to 5th generation but still not considering themselves european so hating the countries and culture they live in. Same in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Germany. But don’t dare talking about it, it’s a forbidden topic.
