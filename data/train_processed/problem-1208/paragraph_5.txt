I don’t think you understand that the requirement for the 2/3 majority of both houses is nullified when a constitutional convention is held. Per the constitution, the OTHER way to pass an amendment is to have a convention of states (know as a second constitutional convention). Then each state’s legislature can vote up or down amendments directly or the constitutional convention can call for state conventions to vote up or down amendments. So the states can vote on amendments directly, thus bypassing the US House and US Senate’s need for approval.
