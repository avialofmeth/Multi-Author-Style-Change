> State Rep. Anna Eskamani released a statement to Orlando Weekly late Friday afternoon, condemning the state's actions in no uncertain terms. "Governor Ron DeSantis’ culture wars are destroying people’s jobs and livelihoods. The very notion of shutting down a small business over a drag show is insane and extreme," said Eskamani. "In the United States we do not allow the government to determine what we can read, see or hear or who we can gather with. Targeting drag performances limits everyone’s freedom of speech and is all a part of the Governor’s sick anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.".
