When they pull into port, ships have to provide the country of origin of their cargo â€” in the case of oil, where it is refined. Figures on oil imports are compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HM Revenue & Customs. HMRC registers the value of a shipment, the country from which it was dispatched and its country of origin.
