The oil and gas lobby are now fully behind nuclear as it will take decades to kickstart the industry after Fukushima with everyone realising what a liability the nuke industry had become. Money that could go to renewables is being spent on nuclear projects that wont be producing electricity for a decade or so. Small reactors, the hope of the nuke brigade will soon be seen as the folly that it is, reactors were made big to use economy of scale, small reactors will cost just as much to run as big reactors if not more.
