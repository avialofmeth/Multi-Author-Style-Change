On a podcast a guy explained it this way: putin does not make deals. He's ex-bratva so in that "culture" they view making mutually beneficial deals as weak. There's only the scammer and the scammed. If you aren't taking advantage of the other guy then you're the one getting taken advantage of. Their words mean nothing.
