Again, if for one second you’d actually read, you’d see that I didn’t say they are not dipping into their own stockpiles to supply Ukraine. That still doesn’t mean that they are not using the “oh look our stockpiles are running low” as an excuse to upgrade. Militaries always have to justify why they need the money for new equipment, and what better justification than “we generously provided support to Ukraine”.
