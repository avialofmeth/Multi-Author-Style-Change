And there you are. Disregard the argument by claiming it doesn't work. Except that it does. That's why Russian oligarchs are "committing suicide" by leaping off of buildings. Somewhere in the morass of Russia's power structure, the elites are getting pressured and it shows. Iran's nuclear programs suffer because of sanctions. North Korea has almost no influence outside of the peninsula and is in a constant state of reliance on China and posturing because of sanctions. Sanctions work. Unfortunately, there's collateral damage. It's war and it sucks.
