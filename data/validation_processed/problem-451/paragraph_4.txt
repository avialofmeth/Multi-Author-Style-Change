It's not mentioned in the article, but there was another story yesterday about Ukrainian repair contracts for certain vehicles being severely overpriced (e.g., $150k to repair a vehicle worth half that when new). And while yes, war profiteering isn't ideal, at least the vehicles still get repaired and can support Ukraine's fight.
