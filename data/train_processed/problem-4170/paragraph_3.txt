The interstage connection to convert a GBU-39B bomb to a GLSDB isn’t even in production yet. There’s loads of M26 rockers to launch the bomb but without the intersection you’ll need a laser to pinpoint where the missile strikes… which is not very useful for Ukraine. These missiles also pack less punch too than you’re regular GMLRS M31 missiles.
