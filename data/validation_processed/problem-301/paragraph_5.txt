Yeah, if the Ukrainian military surrounds the gates of Moscow, it's still an "oh well" to me. Don't start a fight, then complainabout losing. I feel for the people of both countries who didn't have a choice in the matter but there's nothing the Ukrainian military could do to Putin that would make me feel sympathy.
