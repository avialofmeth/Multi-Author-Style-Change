Because as I see it, to stand behind you and the comment you are deciding to defend, you are either proposing to condone it, you are responsible for Trump's term as "If they do not stand with ... depose him and be done with it. If you have to full Qaddafi or Ceuacescu do it. Enough fucking pandering to fascists. Get rid of them by any means necessary.", or what's more likely, you are just an American hypocrite speaking from a position of privilege.
