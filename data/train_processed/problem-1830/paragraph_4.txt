I don't see how they can really monetize it like they have with google though. It would immediately turn me away. I'm sure they really wanted that data they got from letting the world use it for as long as we did. I cannot imagine how valuable that truly is combined with their targeted marketing algorithms and personal spreadsheet on every living human being.
