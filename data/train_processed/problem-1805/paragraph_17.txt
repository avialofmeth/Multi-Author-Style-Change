You equate gas pipelines with security but the whole premise is flawed. First of all you would like to leverage the pipeline against russia in case of agression right? But your threat is against Germany not Russia. You are basically saying" Stop Russia or we are going to hurt Germany!" OH why does Germany not like this, how mean of them to not let themselves be threatened.
