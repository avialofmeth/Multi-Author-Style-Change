True but you also have to look at how that nation is acting with regard to its equipment as well. Russia has been more than willing to throw its people into the grinder but the more modern stuff has been largely held back this last year. A lot of the tactics have been terrible, but the equipment is pretty fascinating, there's a lot of stuff that just isn't functioning. I could see Russia trying to launch stuff, and have it fail.
