Great q. I do think there has been a proven purple trend in Georgia because we’ve seen it for a few cycles now and doesn’t appear like a fluke. A big part of the trend is that Georgia has experienced a population growth of younger and more diverse groups, due to metro areas like Atlanta being attractive places to live.
