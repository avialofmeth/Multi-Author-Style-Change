I am aware of Patriot, they were the PMC on the payroll of a minister I mentioned, I just didn’t want to get into Shoigu specifically because it would mean having to include his whole tense relationship with Wagner. Similar reason I didn’t get into Vuhledar, especially since what happened there isn’t fully clear yet. In terms of Bakhmut I understand why you disagree, but I don’t trust the Wagner Telegrams insisting they are still leading the charge in the Bakhmut zone. Ukrainian sources report fewer and fewer Wagner units present and for the first time in the war some of their units have been spottted at the R&R zones in Belarus and Belgorod. Furthermore almost all footage we have seen recently has been from the Soledar area. I suspect heavy casualties and competition fron Gerasimov and Shoigu has led to the Wagner units not immediately needed around Soledar being withdrawn for recuperation while the Army takes a crack at Bakhmut ahead of the anniversary the 24th. Would hardly do for the Russian media to have a Wagner unit raise the flag on city hall.
