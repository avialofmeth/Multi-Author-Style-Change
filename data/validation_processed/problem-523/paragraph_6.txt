A complete and total violation of the separation of powers. Trying to prevent the president from doing his job via a bogus interpretation of administrative law. God only knows how many administrative laws Trump broke, and I didn't hear a damn thing from the GOP then. It's not about the law, it's about controlling the opposing party and denying them the ability to enact their policies.
