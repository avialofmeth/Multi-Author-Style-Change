But…speaking as a Conservative Republican who would have no problem with Biden being impeached, don’t give me any maybes, could be’s, should be’s, probable’s, sources say, some feel, indications are, so and so might have meant, this is what we think, or any of the other bullshit innuendos that were passed off as proof by Democrats for five years. If there isn’t incontrovertible proof that Biden committed a crime, I don’t want to be bothered with it.
