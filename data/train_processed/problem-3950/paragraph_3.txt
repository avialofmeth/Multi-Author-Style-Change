The American jets are very different. When they earmarked funds to train pilots they also included training for flight crew and support. The components may be roughly similar with each having Wings, wheels, flaps, hardpoints, hud, etc. American jets take substantially more hours and $ to maintain compared to soviet jets per flight hours. They are more complex and difficult to maintain. They could easily turn into a white elephant.
