That’s a suckers response for defending a partner nation who has invaded its neighbor to steal its lands while it indiscriminately murders, terrorizes and tortures the civilian populace. This ‘war’ is a direct result of Putins imperialistic desires, there’s no diplomatic resolve with a tyrant. Putin was coming for Ukraine regardless of what they did or said. His entire pretext for war was right out of Hitlers playbook with Poland.
