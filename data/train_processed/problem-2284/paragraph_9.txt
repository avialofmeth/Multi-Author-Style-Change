MAT-49 wasn't non-compliant though. With the exception to the US, the rest of NATO was already using 9mm Parabellum for handguns and SMGs, so the MAT-49 wasn't anything unique there, just the blocky shape and folding magwell were the only thing that really made it different. Otherwise, in practice it really wasn't much different to something like a Sterling.
