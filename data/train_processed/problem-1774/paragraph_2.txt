Like a decade ago Hezbollah made a video threatening Israel of "פיעוגי ההתבאדות" which should have been "suicide bombers" but due to multiple spelling errors and bad grammar turned out more like "bewarb of succulant bonders" (I'm trying to translate the spelling errors in the spirit of the original).
