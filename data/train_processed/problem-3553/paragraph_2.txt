Katie Hobbes is only about 31K ahead of Kari "female Trump" which makes me uncomfortable. The other good news us the Secretary of State race is likely decided now too with Democrat Adrian Fuentes winning out over the Oath Keeper piece of shit Mark Finchem. That was a super important race for what to expect from the 2024 election.
