Fwiw the US doesn’t sell their arms to any country willing to pay. It is a very serious obligation where you are essentially willing to advance US foreign policy goals. That is why so many countries choose to buy from Russia despite their shittier quality because Russia doesn’t give a fuck and buying from them comes with way fewer strings attached. However that doesn’t mean that the US doesn’t send it to people who my carry out war crimes, if those war crimes will contribute to US foreign policy goals.
