With the way things are going maybe we should stop treating native americans as a state-protected religion and as an actual democratic entity that would be required to have designated election districts drawn by Washinon, which could then collectively elect a tribal government that could then elect a representative to speak for it in Washinon. If it's not a single continuous unit then they should have more than 1 representative. Or just organize them as small states, if they have more than 40,000 people they've met the definition of a state in most understanding of the Constitution. This would also allow them to have a Washinon-supported police force, better access to tax subsidies, and much better financial accounting.
