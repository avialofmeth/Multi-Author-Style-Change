China's passing some interesting policies to protect the environment nowadays. They're licensing emissions with a quota system, and there's been a lot of thought put into establishing a 'circular economy' system -- i.e. manufacturers create products, which are bought and used by consumers, who are incentivised to return those products to recycling companies at the end of their life spans, who break these products down for materials, which are passed to manufacturers to create more products. The idea is to minimise waste as much as possible, and use as much recycled material in products as possible.
