OMG I stayed at this hotel (mostly as a gag because of how unusual it was) in 2019, the only time I’ve been to Berlin. The aquarium was beautiful but seemed like an extremely impractical thing to have in the middle of a hotel, for guests and for the fish—i was nervous something could go wrong the entire time. I suppose it’s a foregone conclusion the sea animals have perished which is super sad…without this aquarium, I have a hard time seeing how the hotel manages in the future and a rebuild will be impossible.
