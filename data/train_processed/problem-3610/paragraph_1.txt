I'm not arguing against you, but you do have to consider that with millions and millions of mobilized Russians facing the truly horrific fight on the eastern front, less than 5% of your army turning and fleeing regardless of how effective your army is, is both understandable and numerically significant. I understand that it was not an even spread but the Russian army at it's peak during WW2 was over 10 million men and women.
