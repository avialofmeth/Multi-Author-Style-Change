I agree with you. I really respect how Finland and Sweden have put a united front, and Finland made it clear that it's in no rush to join and neither party will join without the other. I also respect the messaging from Sweden saying how they won't give some of the things Turkey is asking for because they're unconstitutional. It really shows mollusks like Erdogan what a country with a backbone looks like.
