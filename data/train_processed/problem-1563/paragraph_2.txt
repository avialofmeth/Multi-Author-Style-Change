It's impossible to know when and where exactly it will land, they can only estimate an area. The US had a Destroyer within the area fairly quickly, and an oceanographic survey vessel + UUVs searching that area. It was just a case of narrowing down exactly where it was. Not too difficult considering the waters where it fell are shallow.
