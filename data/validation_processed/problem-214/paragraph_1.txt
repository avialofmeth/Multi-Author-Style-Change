Alright people, the report made by the FBI/DoE is of "low confidence." As someone who went to college for a degree in Intelligence Analysis, this is fancy talk for "We're taking a shot in the dark and we don't really believe this." Saying you assess something with low confidence is also something frowned upon in the intelligence community as it means you're not sure of what you're even trying to say is true.
