It’s so obvious what the Republicans are doing. Any one running against a Republican should remind voters that if you vote Republican, it may be the last time you’re able to cast a vote. They can’t win fair and square. They know it. Their constituency is old, dying, and racist. “Can’t win, cheat.” is their motto. Oh well. Good riddance.
