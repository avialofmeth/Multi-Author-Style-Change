I've been convinced for years that the evangelicals are purposefully sabotaging any peace process that starts up. If you could wave a magic wand and create peace in the Middle East, their apocalypse fantasy would be torn to shreds. So they make sure that not only doesn't peace take hold, but that each side has as much incentive as possible to attack the other.
