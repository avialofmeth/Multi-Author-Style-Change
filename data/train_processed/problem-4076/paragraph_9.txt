You're vastly overestimating the attachment that that base has to Trump himself in the wake of back-to-back-to-back electoral losses. Their goal is MAGA and they can't get that done with someone who is simply no longer capable of winning elections or even successfully endorsing candidates in contested races. Do not mistake partisan spin for reality or else 2024 will blindside you like 2016 did.
