I'm pretty sure we were only able to make SR-71s bc we used a ton of back channels to buy titanium from the USSR. As in the USSR had the best source and mining capabilities for it at the time, so we did some crazy shit like have a shell company in x country buy it from the USSR, sell to another shell company in country y, who sold it to another shell company in country z, who sold it to us.
