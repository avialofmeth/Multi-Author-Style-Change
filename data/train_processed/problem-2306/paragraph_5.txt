Someone mentioned the Anglican Communion; I've spoken with anglican priests who are vehemently pro-LGBT and known of some who were even openly gay. They often express frustration that there's a very broad consensus for change to recognise LGBT equality even at the top level, but because of the inherent power dynamics of religions, the bar for change is extremely high.
