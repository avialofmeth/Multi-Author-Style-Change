The rule of thumb is that usually about 30% of the general election day electorate votes in a primary. And the general election day electorate itself is maybe a third of the population on a good day. So if you're talking about who's voting in the Democratic primary in Arizona, you're talking around 10% of the state's population. Not roughly half.
