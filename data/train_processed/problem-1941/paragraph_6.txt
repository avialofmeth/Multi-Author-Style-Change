The people are prostesting for their anger at a government that keeps fucking up on stabilizing things, specially since Castillo (the one who they voted for in the South) is gone. Dina fucked up in calming them, by saying she intended to fullfil the whole term of Castillo (she's the VP, so she's allowed to do that); Congress didn't help because they were celebrating that they finally sacked Castillo, as if they weren't hated by a lot of people for doing nothing and warming their seats. Since the protests have been escalating, they've backpedaled on the "we'll stay until 2026".
