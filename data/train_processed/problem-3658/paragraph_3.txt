In 2015, the GOP primary field was incredibly crowded, with something like a dozen on the ballot in some of the important early states, and Trump was able to divide and conquer. He also had the advantage of being seen as a Washinon outsider, and having no real political record to defend. I don't think the Republicans will make the same mistake again regarding the primaries, and Trump will have to defend himself regarding hundreds of thousands of covid deaths that could have been prevented, that January 6 insurrection, the 2022 midterm losses, and so on.
