All oil trading in the world has to be done with us dollars. To buy oil normally they would have to buy us dollars, pay with them, and then the seller converts those dollars to their own currency. The us could never have the debt it has and keep their credit rating if it wasn't for this "rule". This is why countries who suggest not using us dollars to trade oil are usually bombed and subject to regime change.
