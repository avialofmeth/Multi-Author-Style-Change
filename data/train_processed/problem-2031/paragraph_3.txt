Yeah military rankings are pure BS because most of them take into account number of equipment or number of soldiers as the majority descision for the ranking. They do not take into acfount condition of equipment and soldiers, tactics, technology, geography or even logistics as major points. This is why North Korea is pretty highly ranked on almost any website you visit since they have a large amount of soldiers and equipment however most of these soldiers are malnourished and the equipment from the 60s.
