Peacefully starting in Donbass. Ukraine should be neutral. No war. Everyone lives and Europe isn’t facing their worst economic crisis since WWII. There’s been absolutely zero peace negotiations. It’s stupid because no one wins in war. Europe was also stupid for over reliance on renewables before they operate at scale. But don’t tell the central planners that. They know better.
