so yes, there is no "live" tracking if you disable it.. but does that change much? as soon you activate internet again, they know your complete location profile from when you were offline. with enough data they know where you will likely be if the tracking and internet is off, even if you don't take your phone with you. since most people have regular shedules in their day like going to work, going out with friends on the weekend, going to the park with their dog etc..
