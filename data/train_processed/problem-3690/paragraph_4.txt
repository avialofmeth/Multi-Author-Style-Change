Despite Russia's general incompetence, it's hard enough as it is for Ukraine to defend its territory. Going through Moldova and Belarus would be a death sentence as the Russian propaganda puppets there would decry it as an invasion by Ukraine and how Russia was right all along. And I'm fairly certain Ukraine would stop receiving outside help at that point as well.
