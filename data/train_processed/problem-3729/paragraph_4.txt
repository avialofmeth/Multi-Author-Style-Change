I hearby announce my bid for Kevin McCarthy to eat a dick. Every time he talks in front of people he sounds like a terrible actor, he’s so disingenuous and doesn’t seem to have any actual principles he believes in other than republicans either controlling power, or voting against everything democrats want. Like not an ounce of contrition or willingness to compromise.
