“But…but…Rich who runs the lumber mill outside of our rural mountain town says he can’t find anyone to work for him Mind you he’s only offering minimum wage to cut and stack lumber all day, but it’s an entry level job, what should people expect I guess he might also be a lil bit racist, ya know since his brother disappeared years ago and he blames black people for it even though there’s no evidence, so he doesn’t hire anyone but white men. And he aggressively drug screens, but that’s because drugs are bad!”.
