And before some dumbass thinks I’m in support of Russia, no. But holy shit the comments here genuinely hurt my skull. How hard is it to understand that global politics usually aren’t gonna be one and done, regardless of how simple the situation might be perceived to be? I’m sure wartime/global politics is pretty easy to pick up given how many redditors here who are “experts” lmfao. Just because they didn’t reach an immediate conclusion doesn’t mean they won’t reach one.
