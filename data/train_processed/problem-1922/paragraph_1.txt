Japan's prime minister isn't even pro-LGBT. He was on record of saying Japan needs to be "cautious" about legalizing gay marriage (still illegal there) because of supposed negative effects on the family. Anti-LGBT literature was also privately circulated among politicians of his political party last year, though Abe died shortly after that scandal occurred.
