My Dad and FIL both hate Trump and also want to see him end up in jail. My Dad also thinks Karamo is a complete lunatic who will destroy the party. I would classify them as typical Romney/McCain style Republicans. Smart enough to see past the MAGA BS, but still buy into the low tax platform if that makes sense. So, there is some hope yet.
