Hear me out. The Watergate scandal lasted over two years B4 Nixon finally resigned. With tfg the indictment is going to be well timed after a Democrat announcement for president candidacy (Biden). TFG will be a GOP candidate under indictment and so the party will have Cheney (supported by Koch brothers) and Desantis splitting the ticket. Biden will walk right through to a second term. TFG will go to jail by trial in late 2025. Expect an indictment in July 2023 to be issued.
