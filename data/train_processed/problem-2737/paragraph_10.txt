And then the arrogance of talking to the US and Europe like India is some huge power that they would be lucky to have while it sits there with an economy the size of one US state and a Human Development Index ranking lower than Venezuela’s in 2020. All of this shit is why nobody likes India and India has no strong relationships with other countries. You refuse to stop acting like a petulant teenage girl and it’s the reason you’ll never grow. You think you were the only colonized country? Nope. That cannot be the eternal excuse.
