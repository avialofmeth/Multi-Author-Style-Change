That's beyond ridiculous, it's also illegal, as I later learned. Companies must return the parts when you get a repair unless there is a hazard in doing so. I had specifically requested they return all the parts. By keeping them they basically stole from us. For all I know the same board, CPU, and RAM were still in there and they charged us $1600 to swap in a new hard drive.
