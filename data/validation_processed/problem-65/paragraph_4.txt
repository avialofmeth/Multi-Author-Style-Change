This was a full time job for a company's worth of mechanics and technicians. And my unit had been doing this for at least 30 years. Most vehicles that come out of the bag just need minor fixes before they are ready for use in the field. So I'd say if they were well maintained, there shouldn't be any major issues having 90-95% of the vehicles operational in a short amount of time.
