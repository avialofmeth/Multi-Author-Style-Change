Like I have said elsewhere, I am no fan at all of the so-called “Freedom Caucus,” I believe most of their political views are utter immoral filth and I don’t candy coat it. But awful negotiators? They have made public their red lines, the hard limits they will not cross. If you are trying to buy a car from me and in the negotiations I ask you for something that is off the table, then you coming back and saying “no, giving up my child, or committing a crime for you, are not on the table and are absolutely off-limits” is not you being a bad negotiator. They’re simply saying “we are not going to vote for someone who openly admits he will just dismiss our positions and look out only for the republican mainstream. If you want our votes, you have to commit to us having some influence over the agenda. If you don’t want to represent us, that’s fine, it just means you won’t get our votes.”.
