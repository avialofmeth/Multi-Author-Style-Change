Then there’s Rep. Andrew Ogles (R-Tenn.), who, contrary to claims he made in his election campaign, is not an economist. Tennessee’s NewsChannel 5 reports that Ogles has no degree in economics and was never employed as one. Moreover, his claim that he was a “trained police officer and international sex crimes expert” was reminiscent of failed Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker’s wild exaggerations about working for law enforcement; in reality, Ogles was a volunteer reserve deputy.
