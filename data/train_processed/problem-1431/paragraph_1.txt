a bear is a brave and solitary creature that can endure with patience the winter. Russia on the other hand is a slithering creep, that lives of attacking thing smaller than them and trying to poison things larger than themselves. cowardly, weak and unable to survive without direct sunlight to aid them with their body temperature. this an attitude reflected by all those loyal to the ghoulish cabal we politely call the Kremlin.
