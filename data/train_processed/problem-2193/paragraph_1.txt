The Egyptians were actually more advanced than some may believe. I can't remember the dates given in the documentary now but they've found the remains of a worker who had an operation performed on their skull. It is believed the person had a brain tumour and the operation was to relieve the pressure. There is evidence that the person lived after the operation and did not die because of the operation. They also knew how to set bones and on wounds.
