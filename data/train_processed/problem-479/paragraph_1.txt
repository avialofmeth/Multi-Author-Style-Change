Yandex and JetBrains (Intellij) were the biggest Russian software giants and now both are cutting ties with the country, following the Pavel Durov's team who were driven out of VK to run Telegram from UK/UAE a few years prior. Honestly, that's just great. By far the best attempt to ruin the country's future and without even trying.
