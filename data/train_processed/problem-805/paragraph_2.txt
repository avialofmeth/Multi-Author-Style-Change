You don't know anything about what's going on between Palestine and Israel, do you? If you did, you would not have written this. It's not about them being Jewish, it's about them being Israeli - again, because the conflict which has been ongoing for decades has been riddled with war crimes on Israel's part, and Palestine cannot be expected not to respond. War is messy. And for the record, many Jewish people are among those who condemn the actions of the Israeli government.
