While absolutely true that decoupling the browser from the OS was one of the remedies the Justice Department sought, it was far from what the whole case was about. If it was, the precedent would have prevented Apple and Google from building browsers - that you cannot uninstall - into their operating systems. It was the anti-competitive practices Microsoft engaged in that earned them the judgement. Yes, using private OS hooks in IE was a part of that, but leveraging their market share to lock Netscape out of OEM pre-installed software had a lot more to do with it.
