In MY opinion, I would love if my life was as unaffected by criminals as possible. I don't know these criminals, I don't want to. My criminology professor professed, and many studies conclude, that rehabilitation is the most bang for your buck. The prisoner is educated on how their actions affect others, they often learn a new skill, and they are less likely to repeat their crimes.
