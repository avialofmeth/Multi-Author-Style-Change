she doesn’t do anything because she cares. the sooner you let go of the idea that powerful conservatives actually need to believe any of the BS they pedal the sooner you’ll understand them. it was never about belief. it was about power, money, and saying/doing whatever you need to to get them/keep them. she will support whatever politics will prop her up personally for a lifetime of wealth and power. she found her market and cornered it. does that make it ok? of course not. but know that she does not care regardless. care isn’t part of the equation.
