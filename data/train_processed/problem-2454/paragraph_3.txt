Here in PA, Republicans forbid tabulating of mail-in ballots as they come in, as opposed to Ohio where it's permitted. They have to wait until election day. Then when it takes PA more time to count votes than Ohio (PA also has a couple of nillion more people), they scream it's a conspiracy or convince their supporters it is the deep state's fault.
