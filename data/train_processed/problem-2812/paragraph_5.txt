When conservatives talk about small government what they really mean is fewer hands in government. E.g Authoritarianism. What they really despise about government is the power that government can bring to bear against them and their agenda. They freaking love government when they can wield its power, as evidenced by pretty much every Conservative who has gained power. Do they ever... EVER actually do anything to reduce their own power? Absolutely not, because that's not in their best interests.
