You mean like how you squandered the last two republican house majorities? Seriously, it's like republicans everywhere deleted the names "John Boehner" and "Paul Ryan" from their brains. And all those years of embarrassing dysfunction that made life a living hell for both of those guys, not that we should feel sorry for them? Blank tape noise.
