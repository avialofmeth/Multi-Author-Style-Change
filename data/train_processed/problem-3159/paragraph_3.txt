Look up Byrna. They make a paintball marker designed as self defense. Fires harder. Projectiles are very firm to cause non-lethal pain to attacker at about 30 feet. If you take the short online security guard course, you can take that certificate to your state and become a certified security guard (you don't have to take a job). At that point, they will sell you pepper spray filled projectiles. These are also legal to ooen or conceal carry since they are not a firearm, and to make them recognizable they are painted bright colors. I am sure a few of these would keep some people from launching fireworks your direction.
