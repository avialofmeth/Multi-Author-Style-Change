I’m pretty familiar with the case since I was stationed in Japan at the same base as Ridge Alkonis when this happened last year. I don’t know him personally but the whole thing was a terrible accident. His sentence is actually very reasonable considering the accident resulted in deaths. The family is rightfully upset but I think they overreached with the publicity stunt to try and get him extradited or pardoned. It’s a shitty situation all around, but the officer will do his jail time and still get to go home. The Senator needs to shut up about the whole topic since no amount of pleading will cause the Japanese justice system to waver.
