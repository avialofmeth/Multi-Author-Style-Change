Not sure about mail in ballots specifically, however, you've got a few different blue counties still counting votes. Garfield (90% of votes tallied with a +14 margin for Frisch), Pitkin (80%, +58) and Pueblo (90%, +9). All of Boebert's remaining counties that have her at a higher margin are at 95+% of votes tallied.
