Debacle in 2004 (mind you Polish constitution does not care about dates - any law is subject to constitutionality check - before and after the fact - as no law can enter Polish legal system if it's unconstitutional) was started is far-right politicians (LPR) sent issue with EU primacy to invalidate the treaties and CT ruled what can be summarized as EU Primacy is not in text so by "friendly" interpretation it does not exist - otherwise it would reach "unfriendly" interpretation and would need to strike down EU treaties.
