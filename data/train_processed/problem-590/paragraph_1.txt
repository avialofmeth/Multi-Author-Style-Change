Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin were allies in WWII. In 1919, Brigadier General Winston Churchill led the British Expeditionary Force at Archangel, which landed with the objective of overthrowing the Bolshevik government and restoring the Russian Monarchy. Stalin was in the South, fighting the Whites, who were also trying to overthrow the Bolsheviks. If they had come face to face in 1919, Churchill and Stalin would have pulled out machine pistols and shot at each other.
