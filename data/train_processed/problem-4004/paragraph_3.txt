The MAGAites crow about voter fraud are like the people who live is towns of 7000 and the 10-15 people who are family, friends and co-workers they socialize with all vote for red, and they don't see the world outside, the hundreds of millions of other Americans. In their tiny minds, Jim-Bob and Helen at work are the voting base of America, and they voted red so how could they have lost???
