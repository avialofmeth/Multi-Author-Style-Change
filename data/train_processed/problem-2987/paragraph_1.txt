I mean cool, but clearly with what you quoted here, this is temporary due to increased rains. We need a more sustainable source. Having more wind or solar farms are necessary to make meaningful gains against non renewables. Hopefully, there will be some large investments in those as well as nuclear energy to remove Russia and oil from their positions of power.
