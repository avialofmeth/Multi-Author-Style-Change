If only there was some kind of system whereby an individual could "check out" a document that had a unique ID and then have to return it and that system could track which documents were "checked out" and by whom and then you could enforce having them returned. Too bad there is no examples of anything like that in the real world and I'm sure our technology is just not that advanced yet.
