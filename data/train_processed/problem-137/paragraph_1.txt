So above 6, and the highest age I saw was 24. Quick math says that's about 160 individuals for each year, assuming an even distribution. Not exactly bad for statistics assuming they actually got a random sample. But honestly it's not great either. For example, one third of my graduating class could have been surveyed to account for all of the 18 year olds.
