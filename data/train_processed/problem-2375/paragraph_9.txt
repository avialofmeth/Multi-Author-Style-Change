China is only "capitalist" in relative terms, to its past self. It is not an economically free country by any stretch. They have allowed enough "sort of capitalism" (since Deng) to enrich a lot of people, that is true. But this is being rolled back by Xi who is a genuine Communist, dumb as a rock, and also a genocidal racist. If they gave a damn about businesses then they would have ended covid zero a while ago, and they wouldn't have obliterated Chinese tech companies. There is nothing left except ideology.
