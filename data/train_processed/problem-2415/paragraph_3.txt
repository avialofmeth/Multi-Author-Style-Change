Now, there was a period from mid 70's to mid 80's where pacemakers were powered with plutonium. Seriously, plutonium-238. It's a relatively short 88 year half-life of spontaneous alpha decay that is easy to shield against. The heat produced powers a thermocouple pile in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). Only produces a tiny current, but it doesn't need much.
