Wind farms and solar farms are still not making enough energy to completely replace oil. Even if we built massive ones, it would require so much material, planning, maintenance, and land. Sure putting one up would be great, but environmental factors like bird flight patterns need to be considered for wind, and a solar farm that requires mutilating the land are also issues to consider.
