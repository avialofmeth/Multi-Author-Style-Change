France begins with the ancien r√©gime - before the Capetians severed ties and began reorganising their fief into a French overlordship what is now France wasn't its own polity, it was a part of the wider Frankish Empire that included what is now Germany, Benelux, Switzerland, and Northern Italy. Whatever we label them (Western/Middle/Eastern) the Frankish Kingdoms, all were part of what the Frankish elite conceptualised as a single unit; to them the notions of these being their own separate entities would've been preposterous.
