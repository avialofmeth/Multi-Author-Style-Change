And while I’m on the subject how did we allow ourselves to break off from the community like we have? We as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, whatever your orientation - alone only make up single digit percentages of the population. We need each other! Accept one another and if you don’t understand why someone is bisexual or transgender or gay or whatever then ASK and ask nicely but don’t be nasty to them or exclude them because they’re not your type. We can’t afford to do that to each other. Each one of our voices is important & that goes for our straight allies too. We need your voices & acceptance & love more than ever.
