As I see it, combustion powered drones will continue to operate into the winter, much better than fully electric drones. It's much more difficult to route heat from efficient brushless motors into the props which will ice like mad. One could swaddle a Lipo with a hand warmer and some insulation to keep it warm, but rotor icing will still be a problem in the mid soggy cold winter. Maybe a combustion engine can heat an aluminum propeller just enough to shed ice.
