I do think negotiations with China will probably be more fruitful and productive because of this. Both parties can set aside the pretension and walk into the situation seeking to regain face. It's counter intuitive but the less secrets you have to pretend you don't know someone is keeping the easier it is to trust them or at least be less suspicious.
