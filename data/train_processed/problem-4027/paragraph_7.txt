While there is value in having an unelected body that basically serves to moderate parliament, its current state is kind of busted. You can literally buy your way into it, or have peerage appointed by the ruling party, basically stacking it like the Americans did with their Supreme Court. Perhaps instead of Lords, they need experts in various fields. Economic, agricultural, medical, military, environmental, the things that the average MP probably isn't going to know all that much about.
