Second link applies a little more, but still not enough to really think that white officers are going to be fired in general for causing the death of someone black or brown. When them being fired is the norm... not necessarily one off instances or here and there... then I would agree we can take a step back on not pointing it out, but we are nowhere close to that point now.
