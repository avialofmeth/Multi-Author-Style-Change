I understand the whole "DAE literally everyone on the planet just became a total pussy in Spring of 2020 when they shoulda sacked up and dealt with it?", but medical supplies aren't infinite. Or did you forget that whole part of it? I'm real sorry some shithead had their Mom and Pop bowling ally closed down, but everyone was dealing with some shit at the time and "idk maybe most of us are gonna be ok..." sounded as stupid then as it does now.
