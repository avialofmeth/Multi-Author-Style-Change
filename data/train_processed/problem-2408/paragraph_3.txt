If it's any consolation, I don't have anyone in my family who is a holocaust survivor, however I have extensive counter terrorism/insurgency training and experience as well as the same for threat assessments and management. I am also forme LE who left the job due to the systemic issues. I too have been sitting at that table since 2008.
