I just watched an interview on CNN (12-8-22) with Erin Burnett and Kathi Lynn Austin, a human rights investigator who tracked Viktor Bout for 15 years. She called him a "weapon of mass destruction" who has been responsible for thousands of deaths and will be deployed immediately by Putin. Austin was clearly of the belief this was a horrendous swap that will likely cost lives. Biden fucked up here for nothing more than political optics. Watch the interview yourselves, and see if Ms. Austin's credibility isn't worthy of her opinions.
