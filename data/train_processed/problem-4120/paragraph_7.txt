They told you everything you need to know. They don't want to care about anyone else. They want someone who will (promise to) make them rich and fuck everyone else. It's not a contradiction at all. They want to be the ones who benefit from the system at the expense of everyone they don't like. They don't hate Reagan for making boomers rich. They hate boomers for being ones who were made rich and not them.
