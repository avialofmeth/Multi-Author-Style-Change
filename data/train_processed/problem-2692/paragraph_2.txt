Iran's main defense against potential attacks on their nuclear projects has been to harden their facilities by burying them deeper and probably to concentrate their available SAMs. Engaging F-35's by moving Su-35's to intercept would be risking their most expensive and latest acquired fighter. Especially when even Russia fully delivers what they're promising to Iran that's now a small number of fighters and Russia already is trying to funnel as much of their resources as they can to their current war effort. Their current exports to the likes of Iran or India are continuing because they calculate that delaying already agreed to exports as too damaging to their long term relations and future exports, or in the case of Iran they are rewarding Iran for moving a lot of useful drone equipment to Russia that Russia needs. But Russia is free to negotiate new orders that come with war time delays baked into the export agreement and an additional Su-35 order could take a long time to fulfill.
