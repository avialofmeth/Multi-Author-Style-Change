While I am happy to have visited India I don’t have asthma and it was still hard on my lungs. I had to borrow my host’s inhaler in Delhi. Kolkata was not as bad when I went. The humidity seemed to help. But Delhi and Agra were rough on my respiratory system straight away. I am sad to say it but if you have asthma I’d advise you to go somewhere else.
