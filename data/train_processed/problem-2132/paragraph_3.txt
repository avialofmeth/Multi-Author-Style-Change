Insurance is really good at finding any reason not to cover what a reasonable person would consider necessary. My insurance will cover part of an abortion but won't cover any of a vasectomy. My wife has recently lost quite a bit of weight but my insurance won't cover even part of a surgery to get rid of all the loose skin around her belly because it's not threatening her health. I've even read story's about women who had their breasts removed because of cancer being denied implants because it's "cosmetic". I wish I was surprised that gender affirming care isn't usually covered but I can absolutely see them taking the "it's cosmetic" excuse every time.
