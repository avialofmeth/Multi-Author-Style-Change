An Israeli poverty rate of 2% doesnâ€™t jive with the assertion that food/a home encourages less violence. Seems like Israel has been emboldened by the success/lack of accountability with their settlements and general oppression of Palestine. There is opposition to improving the lives of Palestinians regardless of any price to pay (or lack thereof) by Israelis.
