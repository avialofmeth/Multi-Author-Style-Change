Soon someone will come and post the animal rights group video of chef explaining a menu of how to cook and serve pets, which is a parody, and think it is a real chef explaining how to prepare pets. This advertisement is from animal rights groups that think eating all animals is wrong, so they video is trying to connect cows to pets, both being animals and pointing out that eating one is as wrong as eating the other.
