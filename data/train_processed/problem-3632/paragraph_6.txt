I bought my father a shirt that said "I'm not a full blooded Jew, I'm just a little Jew-ish." (He's not Jewish, it's an inside joke, not in an offensive way). I thought of that when he said it. Judaism is one religion that is traced through family lineage, it's often treated like race. The term Jew-ish is usually meant to be someone who isn't Jewish but relates to the religion and Jewish community, community is one of the main tenants of Judaism. It's his way of walking back his lie by effectively saying "I didn't mean I was Jewish, I meant I like what they do.".
