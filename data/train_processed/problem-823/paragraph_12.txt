I'm not going to argue that Israel treats Palestinians decently or that they don't oppress them. But I am going to argue that Apartheid is a very strong term that should not be bandied about so carelessly to any nation that happens to be viewed as an oppressor. Especially not when there are other nations far more deserving of the accusation that somehow don't have the UN and the western world's attention in that regard.
