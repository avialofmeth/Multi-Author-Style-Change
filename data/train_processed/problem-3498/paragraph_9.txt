The support for the war on drugs often was an attempt to reduce harm. It didn't work out, and in retrospect we know that there are better and less restrictive ways to actually reduce harm, but we can't expect people in the past acting without hindsight to have done differently and known what we know now. The drug war wasn't, at the time, the "right" or "wrong" choice, the nation across racial lines agreed that it was the only choice. That's not a matter of leadership, that's just where the masses were at.
