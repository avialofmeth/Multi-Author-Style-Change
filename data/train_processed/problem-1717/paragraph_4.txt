That is the key issue. I’ve moved from US football to being a global football fan, over the last 15 years. There is so much money in sports, of course they are corrupt. US football died for me on its disregard for players brain injuries (they can’t be prevented, the game can’t function without them. For global football…. Yup, there’s too much money. Yes it’s corrupt. But fifa ignoring the death toll around building the venues and the general draconic approach to human rights in Qatar, makes it a hard watch. I’ll tune in, but I’m mostly interested in the return to regular play, where I can ignore the uncomfortable bits.
