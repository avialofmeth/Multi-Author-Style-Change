Haha, the US should stop the aid money to Palestinians as well and if anything pressure them to stop the denialism and accept a two state agreement with security guarantees for Israel. Once that is done, hell yea, Palestinians might have a thriving economy and hopeful future. I could see them being an ally like Jordan even. They just need to get over the whole “kill all the jews” vendetta.
