Punishment and separation are the most obviously reasons. The goal of punishment is to deter the prisoner from crime in the future, and also to serve as an example to people considering crime. Separation means the criminal cannot commit that crime (usually) while incarcerated; i.e. you can't break into homes while in prison.
