Yes, hard times certainly did play a great part in the rise of the Nazis. Along with a lingering dissatisfaction with the political elites regarding the end of WWI. Many average Germans felt they had been "sold out" by their government and were looking for leadership that would restore a sense of German pride and honor (Make America Great Again, anyone?).
