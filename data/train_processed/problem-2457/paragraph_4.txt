I agree. I think this is what is going to happen. I think the Jan 6 investigation report will help but they are really waiting for the outcome of the classified documents investigation. Of the two investigations, Jan 6 is hopelessly politicized while theft of top secret documents is a lot harder to get partisan about. That is the Republican end game.
