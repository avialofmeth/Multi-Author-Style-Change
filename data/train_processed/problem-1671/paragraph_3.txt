But it can get worse. We have to live sustainably. Even if we want to just maintain 2.0 or 2.5 degrees of warming, we have to fully embrace sustainability and green energy as the backbone of our way of life. 3 and 4 degrees of warming cannot be prepared for in any meaningful way. No semblance of modern society and all the benefits of living in a technologically advanced civilization can be maintained by small enclaves of people living in climate hell.
