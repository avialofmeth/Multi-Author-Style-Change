I tried explaining the logistics (not to mention the cost) of sending a first rate Main Battle Tank halfway across the world to people who have no experience with one and what that kind of timeline looks like. They don't want to hear it. If their head lines aren't filled with 'X sends Y amount of Z' to Ukraine, they think the west is just sitting on their hands.
