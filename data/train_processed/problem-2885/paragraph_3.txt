From talking to several republican gen z that I work with the answer seems pretty simple, the promise of protecting “traditional family values”. They were raised with the image of the bread winner father caring for their devoted stay at home wife and 4-5 children because that is their identity, and they see the way the world is changing as not just a threat to their dream life they were raised to expect, but also an affront to their morality.
