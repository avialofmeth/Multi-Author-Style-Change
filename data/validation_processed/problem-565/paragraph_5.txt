Nobody could work to earn money. Society would collapse because production of food and other goods would end and desperate people would turn to criminal behavior to survive. Rural areas would be flooded with city dwellers trying to find food and places to hunt/gather etc. leading to more crimes like murder to protect your own food sources, homes, and property.
