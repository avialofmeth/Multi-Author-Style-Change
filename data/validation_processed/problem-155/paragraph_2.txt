I think it's been on the decline since Eisenhower, but there have been a few times when the rate of change changed significantly. Imagine looking at one of those wavy slides from a side-view. Some parts are flatter, and some are steeper, but it's all going downhill. Gingrich oversaw one of the steeper parts, but that's not the only steep part. During Nixon, Reagan, Obama, Trump, and into Biden's administration as well.
