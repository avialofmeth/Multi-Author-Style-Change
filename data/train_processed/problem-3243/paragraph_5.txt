The politically corrupt elites (who are literally the opposite of Progressives) simply learned they can rainbowwash anything by saying the right words, and that the Progressives will eat it hook, line, and sinker. Even when called out, they stick to the script. Accuse them of supporting modern-day slavery, and they'll just turn the argument on its head and accuse the West of historic colonialism, which somehow absolves Qatar of what they're doing today. Whataboutism cranked to 11.
