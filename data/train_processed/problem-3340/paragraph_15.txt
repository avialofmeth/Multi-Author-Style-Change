They intentionally withhold any useful repair documents or manuals or software tools in a shitty way of forcing customers to only use their service centers. It's blatantly monopolistic and anti-competitive, and it's been a central part of their business philosophy for decades. They want to crush the independent repair business. They want their customers to be fully reliant on the company, and they use that to drive up repair prices. If you had options, would you choose your abuser?
