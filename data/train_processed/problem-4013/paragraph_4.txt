If Ukraine so far manages to push Russia back, imagine how much better the war would have went for it, had Belarus allied with Ukraine in a united front against Russia, rather than directly support Putin with territory and weapons (and possibly soldiers, too, now that Putin grabs Luka harder and harder by the balls.) The West would have also been even more supportive from day 1, because it'd be clear Putin is going after Eastern Europe as a whole, rather than just "one country full of Nazis" as his propaganda claims.
