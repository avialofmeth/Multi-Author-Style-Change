People make the same complaint of BMI. however, as there is yet to be a better tool produced, it is harmful to discourage the use of BMI as a measure of better health for most people, since it is not a tool intended to cause harm. MBFC could and should maybe be better, but the issue remains they are still providing a needed service in good faith. As such, your opinion "they are also trash" is simply that: your opinion. And since you are also obviously not an expert on the matter, or you would have provided an alternate source, I do hope you can understand why people don't put much faith in your opinion.
