It couldn't happen overnight, but Republicans play a great long game. Reagan eliminated the Fairness Doctrine, the craft was honed on talk radio, rag TV shows, etc.... but finally in 1996 he found his biggest benefactor in Rupert Murdoch. They spent the next 27 years spewing hate, disinformation, stupidity, and propaganda. And it worked! It helped get George W. Bush elected; it was a key mouthpiece for the Iraq war, it helped get Bush re-elected, it helped kneecap the Obama administration in 2010, it helped get Trump elected in 2016... life was good.
