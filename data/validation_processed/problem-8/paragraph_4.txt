People are forgetting Biden got Trevor Reed out of there earlier this year - another US military service member... Russia will arrest any Americans and trump up charges just to have a trade for when we inevitably catch more Russian spies. I think it's weird that people are upset that an American is free. Plus the fact that Griner was sent to a penal colony where she would've most likely died and Whelan is sitting in a prison in Moscow. Putin is playing right into US far-right propaganda. Look at social media and the reactions of conservatives. It's fueling more division, and that's what he wants.
