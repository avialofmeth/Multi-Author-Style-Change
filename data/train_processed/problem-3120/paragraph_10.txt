Since it appears that some people have forgotten, non-violent and inconvenience protests have been the most effective way of getting your message out to the public for the better part of a century now. If you're so naive as to not understand the history of non-violent protests, I'd be more than happy to have a genuine discussion about the instances that non-violent and "annoying" protests have brought about sweeping changes.
