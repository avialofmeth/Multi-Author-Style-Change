People in the west should be ashamed of discussions of nuclear war, but not the main one. Your nuclear talk is a way to claim victimhood, and then to blame the actual victims. Once you turn your attention to a hypothetical exchange of missiles, you get to imagine that you are the victims. Suddenly the actual war no longer seems to matter, since your lives (you imagine) are at risk.
