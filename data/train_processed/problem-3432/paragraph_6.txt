It can't go nuclear because where would it stop? Russia has used their nuclear shield at every turn, and it's bullshit but it has to be respected. The same way that Russia has to respect NATO's. It's the same dynamic that allows the US to arm Ukraine to the teeth publicly. The Russians don't want it to go there either.
