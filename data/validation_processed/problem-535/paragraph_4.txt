Think about it, my good patriot homie: Death is the same number of letters as "white." And Row is the same number of letters as "hat." Thus, Dre and Snoop are clearly engaged in a noble, covert existential battle for the soul of the world against evil East Coast globalists. Or, like others suggest, was '90's hip hop even more malevolent than we thought: a false flag or psy-op in a Cold War between Patriots and the deep state?
