I had a good friend literally working on Dean's campaign at the time. We talked about it at the time. He expressed a lot of frustration about the media coverage of it and then the polls before and afterwards were stark. I'm not saying that he would have won without the weird yell he did, but man, it hurt him badly, the downstream effect on his political career was long lasting because once you lose, regardless of the reason, it is generally hard to recover in politics. None of this is revisionist. This was something we were talking about then, not just after the fact. Politicians are held to a different standard, and stupid shit sinks careers sometimes.
