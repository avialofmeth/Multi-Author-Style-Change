I can't imagine Poland being able to build a border fence that's tough enough to stop an army. Border walls have never really worked and they don't even stop migrants. And those migrants don't have the ability to fire rocket barrages or call in air support. Just seems like political posturing and kind of a silly idea. A couple of artillery batteries would do more to dissuade an advancing army than a border wall. They should spend their money on things that go boom, it'd probably be more cost effective.
