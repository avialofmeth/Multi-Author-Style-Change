that's why I said 1500 is not enough as a deterrent against military action/intervention. They would need to at least reach nuclear parity with the US. It also depends on how much of the population and cities the US is willing to lose in that conflict. Apparently in the Cold War, the US would consider the scenario where they wipe out 100% of the Soviet population but lose 75% to be a victory.
