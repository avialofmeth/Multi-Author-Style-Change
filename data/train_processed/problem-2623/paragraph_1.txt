Wilhelm and Nicolas were second and third cousins, as they shared a great grandfather in Fredrick William 3rd, and also separately shared a great great grandfather in Paul the First of Russia (son of Catherine the Great) so while they aren’t ALL first cousins, only Wilhelm and Nicolas weren’t second cousins.
