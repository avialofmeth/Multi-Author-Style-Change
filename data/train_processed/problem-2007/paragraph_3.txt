They have been trying to destroy Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure starting from yesterday evening, when they launched 13 Shaheds at us, thankfully 11 of them were intercepted and it doesn’t look like the rest did any significant damage. Then they fired 4 S-300 missiles at us in the morning, which didn’t do much, and one of the missiles landed in a swamp, where it belongs. They did a third strike at our infrastructure about an hour or so ago, sadly they killed 1 civilian and injured 2 more with it, fucking terrorist scum.
