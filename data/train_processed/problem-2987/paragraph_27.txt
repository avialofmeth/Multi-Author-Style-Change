France is one country, and we don't have a time machine. That one country scaled nuclear decades ago doesn't mean Portugal has, or will. France now is increasing renewables much faster than they are new nuclear. Whether you look at just the last decade, just this century, or for the last thirty years. New generation is vastly more likely to come from renewables than from nuclear, even in France.
