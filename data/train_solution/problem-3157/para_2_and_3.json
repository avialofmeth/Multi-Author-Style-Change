    "explanation": "Based on the analysis of the five features, the likelihood that the two texts were written by the same author is moderate. While there are similarities in punctuation style, lexical and grammatical features, and lack of spelling errors, the lack of brackets, colons, parentheses, and quotation marks, as well as the absence of distinct narrative styles and common expressions, slightly lower the overall confidence in the texts being written by the same author.",
