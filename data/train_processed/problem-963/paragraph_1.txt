It's not just about surplus, it's about general trade, i.e. volume. Germany is Russia's largest trading partner by far in those lists. They didn't just take Russia's money, they gave them products in exchange. What that shows, is that despite massive imports from Russia, they gave them even more useful products in return. The only good exports to Russia is the type that will make them dependent on you, which happens to be American electronics and software, since that's the one thing Russia can't replace through China or India.
