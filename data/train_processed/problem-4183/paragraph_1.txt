Everything I said is still true, and the article is operating on the assumption that the most positive decisions will be guaranteed to be made and therefore we should stop worrying. When has humanity ever collectively made the best decisions on a global level? I’m not saying it’s impossible, but it sounds like a hell of a lot of coping in that article without any actual data backing it up, just “trust us, we’ll solve it. Don’t worry”, giving people an excuse to just not make any lifestyle changes because “all those smart scientists will solve all our problems for us. We’ll be fine....”.
