It's not been ammo since Pelosi became speaker, she specifically wouldn't push a vote because she knew the Dems would lose but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Push the issue and ridicule Republicans for voting against bills like cheaper insulin. It's politics after all so embrace it. There are no good faith republicans left. Mitt Romney is an idiot but at least I respect him for have a conscience.
