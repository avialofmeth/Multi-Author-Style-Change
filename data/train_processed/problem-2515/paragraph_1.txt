Can anyone who actually is familiar with Iranian culture help me out? I don't understand where the "moral" line is drawn. Iranian actresses can appear in media without a hijab but there have been women who were attacked by public officials in Iran for breaking moral conduct when posting to social media. (I think as I remember those were social media posts of kissing or dancing or something.) Can you appear in a photo or video without a hijab without being persecuted?
