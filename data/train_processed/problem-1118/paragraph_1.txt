To kill bacteria overall, is simple. They are complex, but have so many “moving parts” that it’s pretty easy to find one to disrupt that kill the cell. You could add something that is toxic to the cell to kill it, heat it up to denature it’s membrane proteins and kill it, add substances that pierce the cell wall, and so forth. In comparison prions are so simple and stable, that by their nature you have to denature them to destroy them, there is no alternative. They have no metabolism to effect and no other “moving parts” they rely to be infectious on other then their innate physical properties. So to stop them you have to alter their physics properties which in comparison is harder. This is mainly why they’re so much more difficult to destroy.
