So no, you couldn’t argue that. They intended to kill them. They weren’t merely okay with letting them die, they actively exterminated them. You could maybe make the argument for other groups that were victims of the holocaust? But then the question isn’t “did the Nazis commit genocide” but “against exactly which groups did the Nazis commit genocide”.
