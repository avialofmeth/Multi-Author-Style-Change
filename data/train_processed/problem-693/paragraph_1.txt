Many rural nurses (mainly nurse aides, the core of any nursing home) are making 10-13/hour to start, if not less. These folks also have to go through a licensing process similar to LPN/RNs (though not nearly as extensive). Long hours, very hard work, and constant stress due to residents that are so demented (due to age and/or illness) they verbally abuse these nurses daily, if not hourly.
