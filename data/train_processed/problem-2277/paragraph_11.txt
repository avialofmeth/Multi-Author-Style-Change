Once we step into the speculative possibility that exposing what they found was strategic, it gets interesting. I certainly think the defense community could have kept this event under wraps (though I haven't head the official story on how it became public) if it wanted to. I mean it's a spy program, their whole design is to be secret so unless something's gone really wrong they typically remain secret even when counterintelligence detects them.
