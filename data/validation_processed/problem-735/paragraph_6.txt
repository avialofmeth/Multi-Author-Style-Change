I broke it down elsewhere, but according to google the average person buys 650 gallons of gas a year. So, at 27.4 cents per gallon they will be paying $178 a year in gas taxes. Tn is increasing the charge for EV drivers to $300, which is $122 more than what the average person driving a gas vehicle is paying.
