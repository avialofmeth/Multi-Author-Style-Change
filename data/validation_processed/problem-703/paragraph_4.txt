Its not a lifetime position in MI, but still good to have a person in their 30's. Bolden was also the 3rd most voted in the recent election in Mi-who elects their state supreme's in a supposed "non partisan" basis. What this does mean though, is that Bolden now gets a full term and then can run two more times after this term- where MI supreme's typically only have two terms.
