what the science community was labeling a conspiracy was the idea that it was intentionally engineered to be so virulent by the CCP in a feat of biological warfare. thereâ€™s really no evidence for that, and China itself has suffered heavily for covid, so even the idea is dumb. if they were designing biological warfare why would they make something that places its origin, and much of its burden, directly on them?
