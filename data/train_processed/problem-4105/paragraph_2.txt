However i do have confidence in the moldovan people in resisting. So it'll be an even more embarassing time for them. The poorest nation in europe, with barely any standing armed force managing to resist a russian invasion which is entirely a possibility as there are still trained security professionals despite the lacklusterstate of the moldovan military. And i am all for humiliating the kremlin more.
