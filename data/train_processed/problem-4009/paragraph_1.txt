I’m on record being against settlements though I withhold that objection for East Jerusalem. We can discuss that specifically if you like but it’s somewhat irrelevant to this topic. Jews did not show up and start stealing Arab land. This is well documented, and it’s a cornerstone of the pro Palestinian argument even though it’s demonstrably false.
