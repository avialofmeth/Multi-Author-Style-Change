Oh yeah, think of the poor multinational pharma companies. How will they survive, those associated costs are DEFINITELY 1.4 billion. Kind you if Bill Gates didn't push for it to get patented and everyone got to make the vaccine themselves this wouldn't be an issue. The idea that "oh people without the infrastructure might try and make it and fuck it up" is funny considering a bunch of money just got tossed in a well and most of the poorer countries vaccination rates are still dogshit.
