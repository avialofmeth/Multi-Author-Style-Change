While it was pretty quiet here, it wasnâ€™t nearly as quiet in Belgorod because our forces managed to hit a couple of targets there yesterday. Looks like they hit both an oil refinery, and a factory that was making parts for the Kerch bridge, so those are some pretty good news. In response to that Russians decided to raise the terrorist threat level in the region to yellow. Funny how hitting their military targets is terrorism, but hitting our civilians with missiles is just fine and not at all terrorism.
