If Russia wants a prosperous future the Navalny guy in prison is probably their best bet. I’m sure he has a few bad skeletons in the closet but at the very least he seems about as ‘friendly’/kinda progressive as Gorbachev once was. Then again this is Russia and.. they don’t take the obvious choice for prosperity (or rather, the choice is never offered and is taken through violence. I pity the next round of Moscow apartments to be blown up to consolidate someone else’s political power).
