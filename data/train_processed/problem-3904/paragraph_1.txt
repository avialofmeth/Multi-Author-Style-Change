In 1970-71 I was an ATC at H201 (which apparently no longer exists), the VIP helipad for 8^th Army HQ at Yongsan. It was the most constricted facility I ever worked. To the west was officer country -- houses, officers' club, etc -- to the east there was a hill with an elementary(?) school on top, to the south there were 144' power lines.
