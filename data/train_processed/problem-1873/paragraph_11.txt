Again, this would normally result in a loss of votes and a correction to keep the party alive, but the right has a group of locked-in supporters who will only watch FOX News (or "news" sources even further right). This means that the right wing politicians can push their supporters rightwards as the politicians move to the right. Add in voter suppression from the right and it's a dangerous path.
