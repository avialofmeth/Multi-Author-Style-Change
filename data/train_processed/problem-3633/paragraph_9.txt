I can assure you also behind closed doors Republicans don't like Santos being in the news everyday with a new scandal. If Republicans in the House had a larger majority, Santos would had been kicked out already. It's only because McCarthy barely got enough votes to be speaker and needs every Republican now. You understand and can see that right?
