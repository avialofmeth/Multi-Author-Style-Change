OK, define Doomsday? Is it a single day where the earth explodes? Cause I don't think the war in Ukraine is going to cause that. Nuclear War? There is no guarantee that it would be an all out exchange, and then, no guarantee it would be the end of the human race. Not exactly doomsday. Sucky day, sure.
