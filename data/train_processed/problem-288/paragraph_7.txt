They aren't. The original NFA included handguns as well and the short barreled rifle and shotgun restrictions were intended to prevent workarounds. Handguns were removed as it wasn't going to pass otherwise but the restrictions meant to prevent workarounds didn't get removed and so became law. In all reality they should've been removed when handguns were and I don't know why they weren't.
