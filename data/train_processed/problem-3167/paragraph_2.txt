I graduated with 72k in student loan debt, spent 10 years living at home (lucked out to pay only 150/mo in rent to my parents) and worked at a casino to get it paid down (first as security, eventually ending up as a dealer). Being at home definitely helped financially, though it stifled my social and dating life.
