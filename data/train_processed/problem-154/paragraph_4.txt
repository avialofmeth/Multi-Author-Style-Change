Haha, but de-fi is bad. Catherine Austin Fitz has a financial rebuilding method that would solve most if not all of the government meddling with citizen funded organizations. She got her families lives threatened and chased out of the US to the Netherlands for safety. She knows more about monetary policy than pretty much anyone on the planet. Self sovereignty with our $ is how we get shit done. Politicians can not solve problems as technology is what solves a problem.
