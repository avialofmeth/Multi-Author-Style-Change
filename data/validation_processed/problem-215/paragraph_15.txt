About your specific points that need to be implemented, almost all of them (e verify, border security, etc) were in the 2013 gang of 8 bill. GOP controlled house did not take it up at all. There is fear of going big bc of that "amnesty" word no matter how good the border security piece may be. So you see there is a history of GOP not being genuine.
