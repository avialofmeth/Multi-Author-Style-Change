Dude. I can't...I mean I get it in the long term it might work out but militaries don't just overthrow a government and then hold fair elections. They have all the guns. Why the fuck would they let another government come in and possibly be more weak and corrupt than the last? Maybe they think they can do alot better. Plus most of the military there are fervent jihadist and nationalist.
