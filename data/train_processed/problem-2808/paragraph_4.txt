I guess I'm getting a little jaded with Kirschner, I'm sure he has great legal insight and all, and a flair for getting headlines in the secondary media like Newsweek, but his prognosticating is not all that hot. If I recall correctly he spent a few years on MSNBC talking about how Trump would indicted over the Mueller report shortly after he left office, and zero came from that.
