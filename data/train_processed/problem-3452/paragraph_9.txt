Bennet's political fate has shown clearly that "his direction" is a dead one. Lieberman continues to ride on Russian-speaking elderly electorate, which is in no way accessible to Ben-Gvir. So, your assumption that Ben-Gvir will in any way or form follow in their steps is ridiculous. The last government and Gantz's actions as defence minister has shown clearly to Likud voters that he is completely left wing and has nothing in common with what Likud voters want. Israeli left creates its estimation of what right wingers will do, based on delusions of left's own eco-chamber without ever listening to what right wingers actually think. The result is that they got constantly surprised, and their stories about how right-wing block will collapse were never realised. Just like they will be surprised that the upcoming government will hold for 4 years.
