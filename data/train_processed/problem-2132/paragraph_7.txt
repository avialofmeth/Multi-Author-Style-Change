Just this year my OptumRX sent me a letter stating that starting next year, they are going to be shifting my Armour thyroid medicine to a level two medication, which requires my endocrinologist send them a Prior Authorization form. If OPTUM decides the PA isn't adequate for my needs, they'll deny the request and refuse to cover the medication for me.
