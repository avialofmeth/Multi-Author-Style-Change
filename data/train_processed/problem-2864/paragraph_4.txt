until 1983 a conscientious objectior would have to give a written application to conscientious objection, and would have been called in personally to explain yout Objection in person and would have to "prove" that military service was incompatible with your concience and/or religion. There was a brief period in 1977 to 1978 where it was easer, and you had only to have a contract for civily service, bat the law enabling that, was ruled unconstitional.
