Since the GOP has taken power have they even attempted to pass any legislation to improve the immigration crisis or corner inflation like they said. This would be the time, they have the majority, they can vote on whatever they want . But no they are playing these silly games and asking for the government to bail them out by expanding the debt limit. These fools are going to send us into another government shutdown. Literally the other day they voted on wether or not the house should be required to say the pledge of allegiance every day. This should be a wake up call for republicans that even if you like their policies they will never be implemented because there are no policies to begin with. They just state a problem and blame the dems and thatâ€™s how they get elected.
