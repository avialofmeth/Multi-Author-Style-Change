Conspiracy theorists like the idea that the world is tightly controlled by a select few. They prefer to think that the few have absolute control over far reaching aspects of society/politics/civilization. This idea that the few have this absolute control allows for these theorists to blame this control on their own personal failings (people who have personal failings often turn to conspiracies to explain these failings). This warped world view relies on no just conspiracies but extraordinary conspiracies to really make sense.
