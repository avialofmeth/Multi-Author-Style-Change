That's a good point. But China also wants to lower their population, especially the weak. Survival of the fittest and all that. Passing on stronger genes is better for the future of their nation. It's sick but it's effectively what's happening. Not sure why I got downvoted so hard, must be a bunch of Chinese bots on here. I don't think I've ever been downvoted this hard.
