This was about Western world that is actually involved in this war and its attitude is consequential for this conflict. Of course jount world pressure on Russia would be wellcome, of course these countries that trump called “shitholes” are possible fascilitators for subverting sanctions, of course western pressure on Russia would be more effective if third world would be onboard with the west against Russia. But even if they would formally be with us in practice these mostly corrupt and semi- or weak democracies wouldn’t be reliable partners, it an effort lost in advance to get the third world onboard.
