One thing that I kept thinking about on election night when the red wave didn’t happen, is a conversation I had with a political scientist who pointed out that polling might be off and continue to be off, simply because some polls haven’t caught up to the reality of how we live. Many people don’t answer landlines, making the pool of respondents far smaller and less diverse, so you might not get a good gauge of voter sentiment. On top of that, there is also a phenomenon some have mused that you may have people say they will vote for Candidate XYZ when asked over the phone by a stranger, but that may not be the reality when they actually get to the ballot box.
