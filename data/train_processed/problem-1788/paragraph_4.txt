This "shift in attitudes" is why conservatives are fighting their imagined "culture war" so frantically. They realize the walls are closing in on their backward 19th Century agenda of pig ignorance. The attitudes of hatred and intolerance that have fueled them for decades are slowly phasing out and Gen Z and Millennials are overtaking boomers as a voting block and they're more liberal and tolerant than any other generation before them. Man, the future is BLEAK for Republicans. They're either going to have to drastically rethink their attitudes, or face continual election loss.
