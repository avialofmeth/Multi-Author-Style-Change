I know only the Church of England to be controlled by a Monarch in the West. And it made a lot of controversy at the time Henry VIII created his Church. Today, it is not controlled by the Parliament of England nor any administrative body of the State. Which have nothing to say about the organisation of the Church, nor its doctrine. It used to be and it was widely disaproved inside Great Britain which lead to civil war and, after, resistance notably from Scotland and Ireland.
