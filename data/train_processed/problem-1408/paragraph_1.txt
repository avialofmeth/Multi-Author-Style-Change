Biggest problem is that even if you don't buy apple, which i don't, the alternatives aren't much better, and anyone saying you don't need a smart phone in today's world are pretty disingenuous or naive. I would gladly pay more for a phone made in the west at higher standards, but they are not really on the market or at least i have not found one.
