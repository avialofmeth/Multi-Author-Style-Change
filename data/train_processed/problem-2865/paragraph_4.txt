So Twitter is now offering anyone a blue check mark for $8 a month... BUT they are going to add another tag for verified people so the blue check mark won't mean what it does now. WORSE is that if you don't pay the $8 a month to get the blue check mark, your tweets will be buried below the blue check marks. So it is pay to play. And guess who has money to throw around for this sort of thing. Foreign leaders, right wing influencers etc.
