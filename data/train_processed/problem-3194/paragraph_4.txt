Thanks for trying to answer my question but I couldn't understand why gdp and in turn a recession should be independent from inflation. Turns out they very much are dependent, so like I thought the gdp is higher when inflation occurs, making a recession less likely to occur in the statistics while in fact the living standard is sinking. They actually invented a new measure RealGDP to calculate the inflation out, but there doesn't seem to be a standard way to do it...
