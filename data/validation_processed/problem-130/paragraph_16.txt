It appears he has property in Georgia and Texas, that’s what we know. We also know he has said he lives in Texas publicly, in speeches and campaign events. I’m interested in hearing what Georgia voters tell us about how much of a concern this is. For instance, we saw in the PA senate race that some voters there said they were troubled that Dr. Oz Mehmet who had a house in NJ, wasn’t a real resident. Historically, other candidates have had to answer for similar multi-residency issues. I’ll also point out an interesting constitutional tidbit- you must live in the state you are representing at the time of your election. Not necessarily while running for senate election. So I’m not sure his TX homeownership disqualifies him, but this is a story I’m following.
