With much consternation, it'll likely be McCarthy. MTG is promoting him from the MAGA side and Bacon (among others) is promoting him from the "moderate" side. Andy Biggs is challenging him in the GOP caucus leadership vote, but once McCarthy wins that, the entire House (Dems included) votes for Speaker. Biggs will likely fall in line and vote for McCarthy.
