I expect most of the devices we export are vulnerable to remote root exploits by default and that 14 eyes intelligence agencies share a database of said exploits which they can easily query on make and model, so it might almost be point-and-click. If not, and if they designed a custom exploit for this equipment, I'm even more impressed.
