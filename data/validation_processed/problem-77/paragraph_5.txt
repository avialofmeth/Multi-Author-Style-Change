Agreed, however that is their affair to handle. They do not want government support or projects (for often good reasons) so the govt is now tryi g to deal with each nation as it's own nation. This makes projecta very slow but does build trust in our institutions and helps our relationships with these nations. I hope it all gets invested wisely but as you said people are people.
