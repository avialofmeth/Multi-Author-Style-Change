I wanted to add that Kian's family have released a video showing them keeping his corpse at home on ice before they until find a safe time to give him a funeral (I have posted the video on my profile if anyone is looking for it, nsfw/l). This is because the regime in Iran frequently steals the bodies of protestors or political prisoners that they kill or hospitalize in order to prevent anyone from finding out what happened to them and to prevent their families from holding funerals for them.
