Awareness comes when people see the truth and coping mechanisms can no longer resist it. We manage to reach a significant part of the Internet audience, but the older generation still watches TV and reads pro-government tabloids.

But I can say that in regional elections in Russia people very often vote for opposition candidates who offer solutions to economic problems rather than “the greatness of Russia.” Democracy in Russia is quite possible!
