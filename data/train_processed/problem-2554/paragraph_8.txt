Say you got 100 T-72’s currently in service, and 100 tank crews. Then you get a shipment of 100 leopard 2’s all at once. Congratulations you have 200 tanks and 100 crews. You aren’t going to just stop using T-72’s, in practical terms one tank is as good as any other. So you’ll have a large quantity of tanks sitting around for a while while people are training to use them, that is inefficient. Much better to trickle this stuff in.
