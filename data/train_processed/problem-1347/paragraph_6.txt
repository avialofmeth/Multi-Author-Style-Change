So what we see here is Zelensky jumping on the opportunity to try and make the Ukrainian case directly to Xi. It's both a clever PR move that shows that Ukraine is looking for peace and a good diplomatic practice to not dismiss the Chinese out of hand, even though their peace plan is a big pile of "meh" and ultimately unacceptable to the Ukrainians under the current conditions of the conflict. The real brilliance is to try and engage the Chinese directly now that they are becoming more entangled in the conflict.
