They did and they were made in Ukraine. Even their ships and tanks were made in Ukraine. Russia doesn’t have the brain power (smart ones fled) any longer or the man power to make anything useful plus they pissed off anyone that could help them. China is not Russia’s friend or they would be supplying them weapons instead of North Korea and Iran. They are scrapping the barrel now using Syrian forces who have just been through a decade of war. Russia got played by everyone thinking they were an advanced military while India and China watched them in real time get smashed to bits and taken off of the list of forces they needed to worry about. Where would they get advanced chips from?
