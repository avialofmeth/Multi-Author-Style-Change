You may know that French elections have expense ceilings, which are very low compared to a regular election in Pennsylvania for a seat in the US Senate. It’s around $25 million for a presidential election (four times less than John Fetterman’s victory, or “Dr Oz’s” defeat!) I think it could be a good starting point. American politicians would spend less time fundraising, and voters would be spared tons of negative messages.
