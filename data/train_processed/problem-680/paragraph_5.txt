This is what gets me about these sorts of arguments. They always point to events that happened decades ago in order to draw an equivalency in the present day. It is entirely possible to acknowledge that there is \no\ equivalency between France and Russia in the year 2023 while also acknowledging the shady/criminal things that France has done in the past.
