I doubt it works out, but that is her best bet. Over the next 2 years she'll mostly vote with the Dems, while looking for any big vote where she gets to be the deciding factor again. Find some nonsense thing to complain about and reclaim that spotlight. Republicans will say "well... she is not really a Republican, but at least she is blocking parts of the liberal agenda, and maybe some Dems will vote for her too". While Democrats say "She really sucks, but she mostly voted with Democrats, so she is still better than a Republican winning." She wants the be the lesser of two evils for both sides.
