What truly wild to me is that if Trump had shown a shred of basic human decency during the pandemic he’d likely still be in office. Literally all he had to do was not be a complete maniac in those press briefs and he would have won re-election hands down. The fact that he couldn’t shows how unfit for office he really is, but it’s crazy looking back how easy his path to a second term could have been.
