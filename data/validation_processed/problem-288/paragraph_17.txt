Add to that this specific case involves a cell phone which nearly everyone (I am sure that holds true of people in Congress) uses these days as a primary device. So if they search his phone as a member of Congress (dispite him deserving it and it needing to be done given the situation) this opens them all up to having their devices searched. Which in today's digital age is the absolute last thing most of them want to have happen to themselves, so again they are collectively protecting him.
