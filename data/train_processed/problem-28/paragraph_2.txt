The fear is more that the collapse of Russia might bring instability to the region. A partition of the territory (if not political but de facto) would see local armed conflicts. The emergence of private military groups in Russia is a step in this direction. Warlords fighting each other for control over those regions represent a high risk for the nukes they have. The risk is not really of them using it (i don't think those warlords would be able to have control of both the nukes and the means to send them), but more the risk of them selling it to anyone.
