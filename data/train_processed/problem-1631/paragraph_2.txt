Well it's either we just let China take Taiwan and sit back and watch OR standby Taiwan, if this is what Taiwan wants and assist where needed. Depends on what we want the world order to be. Russia, China, Iran will happily dictate their terms. They have no requirement for public support or have to worry about being voted out of government. They will take what they need. We can watch and never intervene and never have wars again, easy. these countries will do what they want or we stand up to them.
