Yes. Have you ever been involved (or known someone who has been involved) in one of these missions? Sure, some may be scummy, but the vast majority involve real help like building school buildings/homes/wells, providing medical care/etc. They proselytize as well, but to say they're not helping the indigenous people is disingenuous.
