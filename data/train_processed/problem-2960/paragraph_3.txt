This is why i hate it when people who have no idea about what happened talk about it, palestinians didn't try to take over it was parties both Jordanian and palestinian trying to take over, palestinians aren't guests who we are generous to give citizenship they are our brothers and this is their country aa well so if they fuck up it is the same as Jordanians fucking up and we did plenty of that we tried like dozens of times to throw the monarchy, the reason being is that many were pan arabists or syrian nationalists who preferred unity, it was troubled time but we got through it just fine.
