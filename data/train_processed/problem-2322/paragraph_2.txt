Zelenskyy: "A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about 7 in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It contained the two most important things. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we will defeat everyone. The longest day of our lives.Â We woke up early and haven't fallen asleep since. We didn't know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for!".
