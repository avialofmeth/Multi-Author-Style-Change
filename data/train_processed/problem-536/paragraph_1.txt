Modi and the BJP have significantly eroded democratic institutions in India, including the free press. It's impossible to predict at this point if the Indian people will manage to repair that damage, or if they'll allow their country to slide further toward authoritarianism. But India does have strong democratic traditions and values. Assuming that they are able to return their democracy to a healthier state (hopefully addressing the corruption problem along the way), one would assume that they'll resume the trajectory they were on before of moving closer the the rest of the free world.
