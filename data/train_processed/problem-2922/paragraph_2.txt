This could be a bind for Ukraine, since the most logical approach would be to starve the Russians out once they dig in - but if Ukraine does this, they'd also be starving out their own civilians remaining in the area. From what I understand, most of Russia's remaining "good" army units (desant, marines, etc) are in or near Kherson, so this could be a "battle of the dead-enders." OTOH the Russians have also plowed mobiks into the Kherson front, and it may well be these bullet sponges that the Russians plan to sacrifice in order to let their remaining elite units get out.
