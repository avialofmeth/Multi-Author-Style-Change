RepubliKKKan idiots actually don’t understand that having a college educated workforce is essential to competing in the global marketplace. These fucking morons think everyone can be as stupid, bigoted, and anti-science as they are and still have a country with the lights on. Nobody is going to go to school if they know they’ll be paralyzed by debt for the rest of their lives.
