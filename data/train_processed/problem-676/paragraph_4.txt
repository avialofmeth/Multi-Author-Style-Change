The whole of the GOP and their decades long pushed towards anti-abortion is a major reason, and Donald Trump's dipshittery is the other. Now some of that was McConnell's doing because of his shady BS with Obama supreme Court nomination that opened up that possibility to toss out roe v Wade, but this election was a referendum on Trump and abortion not McConnell.
