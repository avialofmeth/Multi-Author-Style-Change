This isn't anything new. I've been reading The Color of Law. He talks about the origins of "tough on crime" and drug war policies in DC and how leaders of the community: civil rights era leaders, pastors, and an emerging class of black city leaders were the force behind a lot of the programs that would have unintended consequences that would lead to our current state of mass incarceration. In short, three factors that were prime to understanding the perspective Black leaders of that time, in their own words were a need to be a paternal influence, the politics of respectability (We should strive to remove elements of our society that make others look down on us) and the politics of responsibility (ultimately it's the Black person and Black community's responsibility to uplift itself). These concepts led to taking a more measured response than they saw in the 1960s, a movement that was seen at the time to only had modest gains compared to it's radical goals; in the 1970s they eschewed radicalism in favor of playing the game on their own terms but still with a deference to respectability and paternalism: you have to play the game by the set rules lest you lose more than you gain. A lot of the Black leaders in politics grew to form in this era and I think a lot the moderate leaders that make up the CBC still see their social identity and political identity in these terms.
