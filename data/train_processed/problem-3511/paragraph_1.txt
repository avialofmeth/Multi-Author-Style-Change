The fact that fbi is like just come clean and it’s cool. Why the fuck is this cool? Are there no checks and balances when it comes to classified materials? Do politicians just leave classified documents everywhere and it’s common place. Wtf is the government doing where national security is only a suggestion. This just screams privilege like when it comes to people like Hillary Clinton claiming ignorance on her email server. She fucking new she was skirting the law. Everyone uses private email doesn’t make it ok. Is Biden and the FBI going to claim everyone has a box of classified documents in their home. At best Biden is guilty of improperly treating classified documents. A serious a crime for people who aren’t the politicians.
