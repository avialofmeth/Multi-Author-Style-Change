It would be a hilarious pie-in-the-face to Russia if Poland were just given a billion dollars from the frozen Russian assets the Eu has locked way, as a penalty to both compensate the victims families and rebuild whatever was lost. (And whatever else Poland wanted to spend the money on - missile defense systems, new tanks to replace ones they give to Ukraine,... whatever.).
