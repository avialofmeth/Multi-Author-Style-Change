They have to. A Trump primary fractures the party. They want him indicted and convicted so they can begin the whitewashing of their history with him and prop up Desantis as the new golden boy. 100% Desantis is behind the scenes with McConnell strategizing around this, I'll be shocked if that is not the case. Who else can they nominate? Fuckin Ted Cruz?
