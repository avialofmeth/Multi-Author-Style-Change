Lastly, the fact that Germany on the one hand claims to want to show leadership, especially in Eastern Europe, but keeps shitting the bed on all international issues due to cowardice and a double moral standard ( supports Russia and China, makes deal with Middle eastern countries yet harps about leading in human rights) is holding the whole of the EU back. Germany has become the nation that has become Europe biggest political headache and this is even before the are really suffering economically. Their leadership (mostly the SPD to be honest) is failing to adjust to the new world dooming everybody in the process.
