Yeah, he appointed three of them, so much for that "best people" and "great judge of character" stuff he used to spout. And when you look at it, anything he tries to run on will be hit with that question, and the perception of him as a loser will just be hit home even harder. He didn't build a wall, he didn't lock her up, he did nothing for the national debt except grow it by the largest amounts in history, and that was before the pandemic, or healthcare or anything you can think of.
