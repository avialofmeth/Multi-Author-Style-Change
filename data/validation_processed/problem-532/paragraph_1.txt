I think the National Review was correct in viewing them as political stunts. One thing to remember is that Trump had long made the press a political enemy to his voters. I think these lawsuits should be viewed through that lens. He had long told his voters that the media was their enemy, and portrayed them in dark terms. I think these lawsuits were never meant to succeed but to gin up his base. They made headlines, and his lawyers appeared on Fox News primetime opinion shows. These lawsuits allowed Trump to tell his base that he is standing up to the media, and bolster his image as a fighter. Its a political gambit.
