This dispute is a good thing. The inflation reduction act is a massive investment in decarbonizing the U.S. economy with long term goals. As part of those investments many of the subsidies require materials to be sourced or produced within the US. This has made lots of eu companies interested in investing in the us to take advantage of those subsidies.
