I’m not super political on Facebook but for president’s day I reposted Pete Sousa’s photo of the former presidents minus trump in my stories. I didn’t include the caption. I went about my day and my uncle, who I don’t speak to frequently but have always been nice to him and his family. I don’t ever bring up politics at family gatherings.
