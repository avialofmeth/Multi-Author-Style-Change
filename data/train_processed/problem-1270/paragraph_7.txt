This isn't true, at least in the case of BC, I'm not as familiar with the other provinces. BC has only in the last 20 years really had any progress with treaties and in that time only a handful have been completed. At the same time several court decisions have been made that make the treaty process in it's current from undesirable for First Nations to persue. Because of this the vast majority of land in British Columbia remains unceeded.
