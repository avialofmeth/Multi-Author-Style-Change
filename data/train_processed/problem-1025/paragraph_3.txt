Back in the 80's, the airforce put a kinetic missile onto an f-15 to shoot a satellite. The service ceiling of the eagle is 80k feet. Without the explosive warhead, you can cram more fuel into the missile. Works well against satellites. They used the same kind of missile. You have to remember that missiles of that size are moving faster than mach 3.
