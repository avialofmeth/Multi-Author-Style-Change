This is a medical termination, not that of a healthy baby because she so chooses. This is not letting this life be in pain or suffer, and to be clear the only thing the court said was that it was the motherâ€™s choice. Weather she wants to give birth to a still born, wait weeks until the baby suffers and dies, or have mercy and terminate an unviable pregnancy.
