Back when I lived in northern Washinon, most dispensaries had ATMs for cash and the dispensary I hit most often had a debit reader, but I believe it came with a surcharge. I don't remember seeing much armed security outside of Seattle and some suburbs up to Lynnwood/Edmonds, but I'm not often the most observant fella at the dispensary and most places had backrooms.
