That's what really pisses me off. I saw a Tweet with like 250k retweets from some Qatari prince about how they shouldn't be forced to uphold western ideals. You fucking said you would allow everyone, allow for beer sales, etc. and then pulled the rug out last minute. Lying is fucking okay to get what you want and westerners should just put up with it? You never should have gotten the WC to begin with, but the only reaso you did was lies and money. Real moralistic.
