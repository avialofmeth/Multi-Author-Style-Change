Trump also had one other advantage in '16. He was an unknown outsider to politics. His rhetoric of look at all this garbage, only I can fix it, played into that edge. Now sticking with the same rhetoric doesn't pull as well cause he was in charge for 4 years, 2 of which he had full congressional control.
