The US would very much like to get India away from using Russian military gear, and to have good military relations with India. India would like good relations but isn't going to put all its eggs in a Western basket after British colonization and the US taking Pakistan's side when India and Pakistan were in one of their conflicts (among other things). So this might reflect India diversifying, but seems unlikely to presage any more wholesale shift to Western gear.
