Sorry but I just don't buy that. It's not fucking magic and the turbine engines can be serviced in the worst case by having them get shipped back to a different country while the tank uses a replacement power package. It's a convenient excuse to hide behind but the reluctance seems to stem from somewhere else. Most likely political since I'm sure elements in the US would love to refresh its stocks of M1s.
