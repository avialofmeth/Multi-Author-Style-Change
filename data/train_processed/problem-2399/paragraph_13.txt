I’m an atheist but I can recognise that religion has also motivated people to do positive things, if we want to chuck examples around. Maybe people shouldn’t have to be motivated by that, but that doesn’t change this result. From Christians to Buddhists building hospitals, schools, and spending trillions in charitable aid, recording traditions during dark ages, and even motivating some advances in the sciences from Newton and Pascal to Maxwell, Gauss, Dalton, Mendel, Lord Kelvin, Charles Babbage, Fisher, Lemaitre, Eddinon. They were not only religious, but (foolish as I think it is) were even actively motivated by their religion. People from Gandhi to Kolbe likewise.
