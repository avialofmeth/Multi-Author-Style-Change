I read a nitter thread which translated Dr. Zhong's thoughts on the issue. He did admit that Chinese vaccines aren't as powerful, but they were made in the traditional methods, so the side effects are more widely known. He also gave some numbers regarding the vaccination rates. There was fear of a big wave like in Hong Kong, but in Hong Kong, the elderly vaccination rate was around 20%, while in mainland, it's around 68%. He predicted a peak around February, and back to normal in June.
