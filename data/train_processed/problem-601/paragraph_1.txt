Here's what you have to understand. A significant part of the country, maybe 70% really doesn't care that much about politics. If you actually take time out of your day to read political news and type comments on Reditt arguing about political issues, you are NOT in that 70%. When elections come about, these people vaguely start paying attention, maybe watch part of a debate, and then go vote for someone. A significant part of the time, it's based on a vague notion of who they like more. Sometimes it's based on one or two very specific issues. Abortion, or taxes or guns or whatever.
