If Putin thinks that there's no way out of this war except victory, if he thinks that quitting would be worse for him or worse for Russia than continuing to fight, then Putin will continue to fight and people will continue to die. What Macron is proposing is an off-ramp, a way for Putin to pull out of the war with better outcomes than if he lost; it turns our stomach to think about giving any sort of leeway to despots, but that leeway has the potential to save lives and it shouldn't be off the table, at the very least it is beneficial for Vladimir Putin to believe that leeway exists and he might have a way out.
