Also we dont know if these players actually have any immediate family left behind. Most have homes or 2nd homes in North America/Europe. I doubt they will go back to Russia anytime soon. If they have relatives, like a cousin living in Russia... I doubt they will be touched/due to a protestor from overseas.
