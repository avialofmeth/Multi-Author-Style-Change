Regardless, the point, which clearly went over your head, is if the goal is to steal land, they're doing a pretty shitty job of it if they're leaving territory like Gaza, and forcing Israelis to leave that area. They did that in an effort for peace, and they were rewarded with an Intifada as a result.
