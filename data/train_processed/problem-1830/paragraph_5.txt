Nowadays I just go straight to the scientific paper honestly. Usually its only 2-3 hyperlinks away from an article if its got any legs, but the AI can pull general information about those papers existence from the few questions I asked it about theoretical physics and enclosed biospheres. It can't do the science for us.
