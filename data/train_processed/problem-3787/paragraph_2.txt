The government claims that the intention of the reform is to "spend less" because "in the neoliberal period, a lot was spent and politicians were served as if they were kings" which is misleading, the government has even provided comparisons with other Electoral Institutes around the world but it is misleading since our electoral institute not only counts votes, but it is also in charge of giving official identifications when you are in legal age in MÃ©xico (credential which you can vote with it) and it is also the autonomous institute that judges electoral crimes.
