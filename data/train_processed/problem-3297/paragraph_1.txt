Of course. Employees receiving wages are consumers and wage increases increase their disposable income. That means they can buy more which increases the demand for goods and services. Companies get more optimistic about the future and invest in the business (facilities, technology, people) and hire more people. More demand for people means wages go up further increasing the disposable income and the virtuous cycle continues.
