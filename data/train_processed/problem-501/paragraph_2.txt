And if someone thinks that they don't cover up their numbers then he is insane. In country of 1.4 bilion people they have 5242 deaths. China was starting place of this disease and they have this low official number. If you believe in this then I have one question for you. Are you freaking insane ? This statement from this local official contradicts the official statistic from China. They have official statistic of 503,302	cases and he says around 88 milion had this disease. Even if he is wrong by 90% this still is only one province in this massive country. We will never truly know the number of deaths and cases because even CCP doesn't know those numbers.
