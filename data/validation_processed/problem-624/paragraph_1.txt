If that was true, I think it'll have been her turn by now. I think it's more like Dems have a respect for people who have invested in the party itself. People who have helped others raise money, campaigned for other, people who have paid their dues. That doesn't mean a young person like Obama couldn't come from nowhere, but even he put in some work. That's why people like HRC is so well respected in the party. She shows up for others.
