I'm talking about radio dramas, movies, novels, video games, and TV shows. There were multiple generations who grew up with the idea being thrown around that Russia was a considerable military threat, even without the use of a nuke. I can't help but imagine that that notion died in Ukraine, along with a good chunk of Putin's cardboard army. It almost makes me wonder if any future video games will continue to use Russia as the opposing team in military shooters?
