His war strategy was literally to graft as much as possible from the lend lease act, hoard the supplies, wait for America to come and win the war for him and rule as dictator. He was so bad, he was kidnapped by one of his own generals because he was forcing a suicidal attack and needed to be stopped. The only reason he was released was because there was no one to take his positon of supreme commander.
