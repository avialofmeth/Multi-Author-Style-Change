more really. the US was all over the place. US also didn't have locals car bombing their logistics on the regular. drone striking anything that moves. this war is a slog more than russia ever thought it would be. even the US would have to do the draft if it got into a fight like this. we only have sub 500k active duty, sure we can get that number up with the reserve and guard. but, we still don't have enough warm bodies to occupy one of the largest countries on the planet without a draft.
