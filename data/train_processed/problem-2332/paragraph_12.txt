However, the irony is not lost on me, that while trying to point to "good things" Republicans have done - you highlight a bill that they gutted the reporting/safeguards from before signing it into law, and then proceeded to just skull fuck the stated intention of when it came to actual implementation, such as when Trump's Sec.Treasury allowed it to be applied to the largest industrial park in the United States, because some other crusty old 80s investor mate with a past that makes Monty Burns look like a saint had an investment in it.
