The lawyer immediately goes to the police station or the juvenile detention center and tells the person not to speak to the police and tells the police that no questioning is to occur without the lawyer present. Then the lawyer meets with the family and they all get on the same page with a uniform story. This is a "troubled child," this is a difficult time for the family and they will do whatever they need to get their son help. The express goal is to avoid their son getting charged or going to jail because that's something that happens to "bad people.".
