The Chinese buying important assets from countries that they trade with is a worldwide issue. In my country we've sold the port in our most strategically important city to them, Darwin was the only one of our cities to get bombed in WWII (by an expansionist and nationalist East Asian power) and right next to our US military base where 2k soldiers rotate in and out.
