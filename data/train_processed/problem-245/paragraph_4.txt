Germany's logic is bizarre, that German tanks killing Russians creates some kind of moral issue. The tanks were built to defend Europe from Russian aggression which would be killing Russians. German tanks killed as many Ukrainians as Russians in WWII so, as the article points out, using them to save the Ukrainians now is morally correct.
