The question is always who gets to decide who is silenced? Is it just mob rules where every controversial opinion gets censored? If I believe we should have bordera s enforced by law or you believe the US is imperialist and should stay out of foreign wars,and my neighbor is against race based favorites, and your mom thinks whites should pay reparations...who is silenced?
