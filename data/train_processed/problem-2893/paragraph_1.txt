The economy is about producing a productive output, not about entertaining spectators or winners gaining wealth. If the economy were a football game, the only useful outcome are the touchdowns. Does the defense make touchdowns harder or easier to come by? Nobody cares how exciting our struggle to find a cure for cancer is or who does it, they just want everyone with cancer to have the cure. They don't care about the "game", they just want as many touchdowns as possible.
