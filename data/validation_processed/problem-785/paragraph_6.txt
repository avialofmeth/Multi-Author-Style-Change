TLDR: Tons of laws were broken here. All these laws were easily circumvented and are hardly enforced. We should be enforcing them more, rather than adding more laws that are also easily circumvented. That's the solution I'm discussing. Not banning all guns. Not ridiculous sarcastic and villainous comments about shooting a 6 year old.
