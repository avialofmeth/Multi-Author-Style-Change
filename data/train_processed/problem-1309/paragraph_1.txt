The EC president is elected by the EP, but the Council nominates candidates to be voted on. This nomination could be seen as merely ceremonial, or a formality as a safety mechanism of last resort so the Council could step in to prevent a potential despot from getting elected. In this interpretation, it's analogous to how the PM is nominated by the monarch in the UK, how the German president nominates a candidate for chancellor for the Bundestag to vote on, or along the lines of how its technically the Electoral College that elects the president in the US.
