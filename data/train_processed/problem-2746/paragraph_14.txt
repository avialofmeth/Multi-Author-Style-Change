I listened to an interview with a Toronto police officer and he said there was so much evidence, the suspects were all picked up and charged in under 24 hours. They murdered this man in one of the densest areas of downtown Toronto. CCTV cameras are everywhere, and their cell phones pinging off all the towers in the area are just some of the incriminating evidence. Allegedly, part of this was planned online, and the police have records of all their communications.
