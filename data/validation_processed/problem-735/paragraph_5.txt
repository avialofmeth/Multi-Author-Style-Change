That makes sense only if they are evening out the average. Meaning that they have found that the average person pays $300 in tax from filling up their gas tank. Google says the average driver uses about 650 gallons a year. Tn charges 27.4 cents per gallon. So, approximately $178 dollars a year in tax per person earned through a gas tax. They want to up the electric tax to $300. So, unless TN drivers have a much higher average usage, or google is wrong, they're overcharging electric car users by approximately $122 a year.
