Having lots of Russians in your country is dangerous. For starters, Russia uses the presence of Russian speakers as a basis to claim rights to otherwise sovereign territory. Plus, most of these people fleeing are absolutely part of the problem. They support the corruption and political violence. They support Putin. They just don't like that they are feeling the consequences of those decisions. The last thing most western nations should want is a bunch of Russians who don't really believe in democracy or equitable governance suddenly flooding through their borders. It's a recipe for massive internal instability.
