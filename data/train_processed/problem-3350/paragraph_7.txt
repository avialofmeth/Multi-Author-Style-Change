We are this ageâ€™s extinction event. Species are dying exponentially because of our unrestrained consumption and pollution. The less species there are, the more vulnerable the whole eco-system is to catastrophic failure. On the one end, breaking the oxygen cycle is a possibility. But more certainly, our children will have a lower standard of living than we enjoyed, poorer with shorter life spans. And rather than address this, our consolidation prize is corporations booking record profits.
