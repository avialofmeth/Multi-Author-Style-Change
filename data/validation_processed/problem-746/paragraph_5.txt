1. Crimea used to be controlled by Ukraine until 9 years ago. People born back then are literally fucking not out of elementary school. It's not, "historical justice", because that would imply they are trying trying to reclaim territory that they lost decades or centuries ago. It's a recent, ongoing conflict.
