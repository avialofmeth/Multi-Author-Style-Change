This is much worse (for the world) than not emitting sooner but probably less profitable for Norway. It sucks that this is the path they seem to have chosen (I am just going off what people are saying in this thread) because you already are very rich and have a sovereign wealth fund. You don't need to do this and can instead be a good example to the other petro states.
