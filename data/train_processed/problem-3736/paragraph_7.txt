I mean from what I've seen, it looks like he was sent in with the mysterious backed funding to just continue to sow discord in American government. His "ill resign if 142k ask me to" is obviously bs. You can tell he purposely flash the okay hate symbol to get people riled up online on both sides. If they don't force him out, I am 100% sure he is going to be like mtg and Dumbart doing anything and everything to get his name in the news.
