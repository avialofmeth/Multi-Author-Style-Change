When I was a small child I used to visit the old Laurel shopping center with my grandparents in Maryland where a few years earlier Wallace was shot, paralyzed, and which as a result of began rethinking his positions and making apologies. The shopping center or State, I dunno which, erected a plaque to the event that was a sorta strange point of pride for locals. (And admittedly myself ðŸ˜¶).
