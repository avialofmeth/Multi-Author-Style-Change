Russia has a unique prison and criminal culture due to the gulags in the Soviet days in many gulags gangs of prisoners were pay to help quell the growing rebellion’s from the other prisoners after the Soviet got rid of most of their gulags many of theses gangs stayed together making a business smuggling in western products to The ussr. After the fall of the ussr these now criminal empires gained vastly more power and now have large sway over the Russian government. I not so sure how much criminal’s dislike the current Russian government seeing how corrupt it is though it probably depends on the person.
