Is it just me or are these takeover bid amounts getting into "500 Squillion-Bazillion dollar" range? The sort of number you throw out as a kid when trying to bluff through a bullshit bet. It's almost like one small enclave of town has unlimited money and everyone else is living in Oliver Twist levels of poverty.
