So basically you are saying an object roughly the size of three city busses flying at 60000 feet was not observed by commercial airline pilots, all of news media and local citizens not once but three times. But this time it was? How about receipts? "The Pentagon" says is not a receipt. We track everything... everything in our airspace. How come no dates nor radar tracks are produced, just a blanket statement. Kind of like saying we got all Americans out of Afghanistan, while leaving thousands behind, or Biden saying he had nothing to do with Hunters businesses. And the laptop isn't Hunters, oops, wait a minute, didn't he counter sue the Apple repairman saying that he stole the laptop. ðŸ¤£.
