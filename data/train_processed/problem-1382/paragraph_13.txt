Like I said, they didn't hold their first democratic elections until 1994. The first ruler of an independent Haiti, Dessalines, declared himself emperor and was then assassinated two years later. His death lead to a 14 year-long civil war, between a dictator who then declared himself king and a republican dictatorship. The Republican dictatorship won but assassinations and coups was rampant. Then the last one declared himself Emperor Faustin and ruled as such for ten years. Then Faustin was overthrown by a military coup and there were a long of dictators followed by an American occupation that lasted for 19 years until 1934. Then there were a bunch of dubious elections and military coups every few years. That's the main reason why Aristide abolished their armed forces, because they never did anything useful but constantly overthrew civilian governments without provocation.
