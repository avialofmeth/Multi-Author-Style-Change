If this is true, I'm not sure and not sure if I belive it myself but the fact that Putin is keeping the in line one way or another I do belive and if he were to die before this war is over Russia is going to be in a very bad situation internally, I do belive their isn't a successor either because Putin is known to be paranoid and he wouldn't want somebody who can challenge him to take over if he fucks up too badly like he has done in Ukraine.
