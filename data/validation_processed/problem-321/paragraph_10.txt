I am not one of those "boomers who think television makes people insensitive to violence" but I am. It doesn't make sane, rational, and/or empathetic people insensitive to violence. I believe that group of viewers is the majority but it also exposes the minority of psychopaths to that shit and makes them feel it's not profoundly abnormal.
