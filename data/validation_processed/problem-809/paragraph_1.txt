$500 over four years is gentle compared to mine. I live in a rural area, and signed a lease for my apartment in November 2021 for $1100/month. In November 2022, when they were renewing leases they wanted $1500/month for the next year. Meanwhile my job gave us 2.3% cost of living raise to balance inflation lol. This apartment offered no amenitys other then some ran down basketball hoops. I said fuck that and found somewhere cheaper.
