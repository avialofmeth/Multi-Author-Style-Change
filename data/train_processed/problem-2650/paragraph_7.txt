No that's just a fantasy word used by US to refer to who they like more, there was only one single election in 2012 and never happened again, ironically the current head of western Libya government refused to hand over power after the end of his term as prime minister and who support him ? Exactly the militias, today Tripoli is divided between militias groups and they even fight with each over power.
