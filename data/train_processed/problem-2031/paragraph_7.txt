Definetly not, the US nowadays is the only real country with thr ability to project power anywhere in the world without outside help. Britain might be able to contend with the US but they haven't to my knowledge fought an adversary beyond their borders alone since the Falklands so we don't really know. France is already out of the question since they required US Airlift logistics to carry their troops and equipment across the Mediterranean into Mali for their war there. China does not possess a blue water navy and instead focuses on coastal ships for combat near their own coast. Russia well, we've seen how their army has performed and their only aircraft carrier is a steaming pile of dogshit riddled with stupid descisions from the USSR era such as what fuel type it's reactors can use which was a result of soviet buerocracy in the design process which has led to it breaking down so often.
