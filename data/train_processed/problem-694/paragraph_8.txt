I mean it's almost as if you don't know anything about what's going on. I don't know how you managed to live past the last few years without any learning about Florida fuhrer. Google DeSantis and Disney, or cruise industry, state epi, the NHL. I find it concerning that you somehow missed the last two years of current events.
