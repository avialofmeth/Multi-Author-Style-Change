Steve Jobs was a huge asshole, and did very little of the actual innovating himself, just like Elon. But he also came from relatively normal middle class family, and worked his way up from being an intern at Hewlett Packard to iconoclast head of the 1 technology company of all time. Some part of him, even when he was a huge dick to those around him, understood the customers they were going after and how he was presenting himself to them.
