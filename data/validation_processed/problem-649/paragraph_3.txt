These are all excellent points, but I do want to add that while we were lucky the Roe reversal was timed so poorly for the GOP, it is inevitable due to their party’s nature that they will continue to take advantage of their position and pull further attacks upon the rights of the citizens all for their own Christian nationalist extremism. There just is no curbing extremism, and once it gets power, like they do in the SCOTUS, they’ll just keep pushing.
