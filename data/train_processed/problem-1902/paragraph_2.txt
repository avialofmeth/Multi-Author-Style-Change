If we are to talk about welcoming Russia back into the global community, aside from the removal and execution of putin, the Russian people need to be treated exactly like the Germans post ww2. They need to be systematically denazified and efforts must be taken to correct the insane brainwashing that has held the country for almost a century. Russia doesn't need to blame the west for their failures anymore, they are the cause of their absolutely shit country and they need to step up and own that.
