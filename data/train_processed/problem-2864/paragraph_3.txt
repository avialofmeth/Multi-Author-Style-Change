While the percentage of actually serving constricts dropped significantly over the years (only around 20% of eligable males served their year of "mandatory" service) due to ease of refual (wich wich case you would serve in civil service instead) and low actual constriton rate (less than half were judged "able to serve"), Pistorius is from a generation when more or less all males would have actually served their mandatory military service, so this is not very notable.
