Like... this happens in all kinds of militaries around the world. Sometimes someone in strategic command makes a call about what a unit should be sent to do, that turns out to be a huge mismatch. The USA lost a bunch of their Special Forces a while back when they were given a task more suited to a regular infantry unit. Lacking the necessary combat support for a fixed engagement, the Special Forces people got crushed. It wasn't that they sucked, they were just fighting the wrong fight.
