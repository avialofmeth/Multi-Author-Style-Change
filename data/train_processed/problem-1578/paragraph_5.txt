This does not seem to be entirely true. Sure there is a bigger part of Wagner made of prisoners. But there is that core of professional soldiers that are decently supplied compared to regular ru army. So they use raag prisoners to discover or weaken enemy positions and then pros do the sweeping. This is why Wagner seemingly does produce any tangible results at all. But that professional Wagner core is about 10k soldiers according to some counts... Not exactly that many given size of entire conflict. They are doomed either way.
