The lawsuit was brought by a woman alleging she was sexually abused as a child by her foster father in the 1980s while under the care of the children’s aid society’s predecessor organization. McCallum made the statement in a July 2018 affidavit responding to an affidavit from the plaintiff’s lawyer, Simona Jellinek.
