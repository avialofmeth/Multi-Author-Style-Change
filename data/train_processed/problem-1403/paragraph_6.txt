McConnell’s properties have always been self > financiers > party > … > somewhere down the list the country matters, but to be honest, I’ve never heard McConnell actually claim any duty to the country, constitution, or even his constituents. He tends to call them great or important, but never really talks about them in a personal sense. He doesn’t serve the country, state, or his constituents… they’re just tools & backdrop for welding power.
