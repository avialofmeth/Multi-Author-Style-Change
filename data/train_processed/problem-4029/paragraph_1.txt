In the ‘90s my cousin was telling us about an incident that happened when she was in line at the grocery store. The person being rung up was using food stamps and on the belt there were some junk food items like Little Debbie snack cakes and chips. The older woman next in line was eyeing the stuff and then turned to my cousin and starting talking about how that mom should be ashamed to buy junk food and how food stamps should only be used on fresh food items. My cousin told her that if they were on food stamps that meant they probably didn’t have money for outings to Baskin-Robbins and those snacks were their treats for the month. She said the lady looked surprised by my cousin’s defense but shut up. We grew up poor, we couldn’t afford outings, so junk food was our treat. I think that’s pretty common.
