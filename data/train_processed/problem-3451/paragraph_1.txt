The historical test is bullshit. If that's the defining test for Constitutionality, then Thomas should have his marriage voided and shouldn't be allowed any sort of power, especially on a court. Women too. Domestic violence would mostly become (legally) a thing of the past. Historically courts were concerned with keeping the nuclear family together, not protecting victims. And I guess that means we can get rid of labor law regarding children too. Oh and safety regulations. You know, maybe this historical precedent thing has got something to it. It could certainly be used against Republicans.
