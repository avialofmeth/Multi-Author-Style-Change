To some degree for sure but ultimately people do this because there’s nearly zero viable way to get a dog one place from the other in the air. Flying dogs under the plane in the winter pretty much isn’t available anywhere and airlines have a long history of killing dogs in cargo. This phenomenon more so shows demand in a free market that is yet to be properly serviced. Surprised some under utilized airline hasn’t made a pay for your pet service yet.
