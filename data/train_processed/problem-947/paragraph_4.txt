This, by the way, from a Prime Minister who was caught having worn blackface as an adult so many times he can’t even remember them all and then “apologized” by saying this was a learning moment for everyone, and also who loudly expresses his support for feminism but later blamed his victim for experiencing their encounter differently after it came to light he had groped a young reporter. So maybe not the kind of person we might want dictating morals to everyone else.
