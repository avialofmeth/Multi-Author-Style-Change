Went to a school where the girls regularly had to line up and kneel in front of the principal so they could measure if our skirts fell within 2” from our knees. All the girls that were rolling their skirts would just unroll them before they got measured and re roll them on the way back to class. If these schools honestly have that much of a problem with short skirts why don’t they just make everyone wear pants? Why even have skirts as a uniform option.
