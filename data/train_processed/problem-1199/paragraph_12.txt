There is absolutely no reason for Starbucks employees to unionize. Sorry, there just isn’t. The people working at Starbucks are not working in harsh conditions. They aren’t being asked to work crazy hours. The turnover rates are relatively high because no one starts a job at Starbucks expecting to make a career if it, and if they are they will move into management anyway. Average tenure at Starbucks is like 18-24 months because it’s a bunch of college kids. This union push at Starbucks is entirely driven by the unions and not the employees. It is 100% fact that union agents will apply for jobs and start working to unionize from the inside. The reason it hasn’t taken off is because no one gives a fuck.
