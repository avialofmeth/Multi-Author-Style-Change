They have a potential for tourism. But its strange for a place to house a military community and see little to no growth put forth by the people elected. Education in certain towns failed a lot of kids. However, BOCES is a good alternative for high schoolers uninterested in higher education beyond a trade. I wasnt politically active at that time and became more aware after i left NY. But upstate NY is a deeply depressing area depending on where and there’s so much wasted potential because of voter choices. There’s not really a job market either besides health care.
