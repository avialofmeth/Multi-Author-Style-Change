Lol didnâ€™t China only recently announce they are banning the sale of military grade semiconductors to Russia. I cannot help but feel that Russia greatly overestimates their alliance with China let alone Chinas long term intentions. Putin seems to be grasping straws with his economical threats and nuclear rhetoric, and until Russia brings some type of noteworthy victory to the table China can only see Russia as a loser in this war and therefor vulnerable.
