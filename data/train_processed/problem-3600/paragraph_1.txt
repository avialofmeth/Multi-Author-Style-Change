Also, and I can not stress this enough, 30 years of attacks on and an overall negative perception of the democratic candidate... the problem being that she waded through so much shit in her career that she will never be able to get the stink off, right or wrong Hillary is a great policy wonk, a bland politician, and an awful campaigner. Democrats knew this which is why Hillary and her allies like Debbie Wasserman Schultz promoted Trump because he was the republican she had the best shot at beating... and except for the electoral college she did... but thats the one that counts.
