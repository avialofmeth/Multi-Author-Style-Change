One can only hope that this is the guy to bring Trump to real justice. Trump has made a mockery of our justice system with his constant barrage of appeals and frivolous lawsuits. If this guy doesn't bring Trump before a judge, in person, and make him answer for his crimes, then our system is a joke. The belief that no one is above the law will be a proven myth.
