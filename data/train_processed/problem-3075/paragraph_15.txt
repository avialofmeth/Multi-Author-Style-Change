Iirc there was a case in Florida of a GOP candidate funding a third party candidate with the same name as his dem opponent. So if we are competing for scumminess there is no contest. But I find it hard to criticize the dems here. The ads I saw were not endorsing the views but warning they were dangerous. It is only “boosting” the candidate if you believe the GOP base are mindless contrarians that will vote against anything opposed by the dems.
