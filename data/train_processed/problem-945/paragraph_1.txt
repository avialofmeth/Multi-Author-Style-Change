Not really. I’m a war between US and China, sure the US wins. But if China were to attack Taiwan, they have a substantially bigger fleet in the region. By the time the rest of the Us navy makes it there, Taiwans probably already captured (based on almost every war simulation ever) …if you’re not counting nukes. At that point every can change.
