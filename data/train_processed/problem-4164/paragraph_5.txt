despite all that, the f-35 is now the cheapest option in unit price, despite it being way more capable than any contenders including the gripen. it's like a tesla Y dropping in price to being cheaper than a corrolla. it's just hard to justify buying the latter unless you have some sort of stance against buying tesla.
