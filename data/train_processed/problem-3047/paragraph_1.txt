Given what they'd just been through to secure independence, it probably shouldn't surprise you to learn that the founders were, generally, super horny for guns. That's not a joke. The Federalist Papers, which were supposed to be a sales pitch for why the U.S. Constitution was awesome, regularly reassured people that if anything too shitty happened as a result of various unpleasant compromises, there could just be another violent revolution. The threat of such a violent revolution was appealed to as a reason why, for example, an entirely-possible 'minority federal government' (sound familiar?) would not unduly abuse its position.
