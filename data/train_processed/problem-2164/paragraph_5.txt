Please show yourself some grace. It's okay to not be an activist about things we know little about. It can often be okay to not have an opinion about everything. What's not ok is what many politicians, from grassroots to federal, is actively acting in such a way that continually marginalizes and dehumanizes others. Learning from our mistakes in a way that will positively affect others is important for our growth and progress.
