I don't think so. For all that Trump was an insufferable twit, and complete moron, he does have a sort of nasty charisma about him, especially when speaking publicly, in front of supporters, and especially when posed with an opponent. Remember when he was going after the other Republican nominees like an attack dog on stage? Yeah, everybody laughed at him taking down the others a peg, but while left leaning viewers laughed at his brutish tactics and buffoonery, his supporters laughed at him bullying others, establishing dominance, and promptly voted for him.
