At the very least it's an interesting thought experiment. I think the UK is correct in that under their laws, she is not stateless despite losing her UK citizenship. I also think at the same time Bangladesh is also correct in saying she's not a Bangladeshi citizen under their laws. I'd say it sucks to be her, but eh.
