Yeah, my Ex-Nephew-in-Law-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named was the same way. Said he was the only one to survive a wreck, albeit with terrible injuries. My brother-in-law was a cop; no reports of accidents. And not a mark on him. Lied about stealing medications from me and my dying mother, although the bottles were found in his possession. Claimed that there was a contract out on him. At his wedding, pretended to have food poisoning; no one knows why. Even my niece finally got tired of him; he'd been banned from family gatherings for years. We were so thankful she never had kids with him.
