Because if he went by what the cops said, what happened to Breona is horrible. But that would be more on the cops than the judge. If I'm missing any parts that would make the judge just as guilty, then can someone chime in? Not really defending the judge as much as wanting a fuller picture of what the judge may had done that was wrong.
