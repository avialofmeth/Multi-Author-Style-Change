It reminds me of the time that Obama agreed to take live questions from congressional Republicans. Fox News promoted it for weeks thinking that Obama was cornered and that they were going to get enough gotcha soundbites to play back for the rest of his term. Instead, after about a half hour or so of Obama deftly dismantling every single Republican talking point they cut away for some absolutely irrelevant bullshit as MSNBC giddily continued with live coverage.
