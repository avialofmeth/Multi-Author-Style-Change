Shutting down shops, going out in the streets and protesting, and getting your people arrested by the thousands while the mullah thugs roam with impunity is a far cry from the people taking up arms and outright killing the thugs trying to impose brutal authoritarian rule. That's what actual "fighting like hell" looks like - at this stage they are merely still protesting. And protesting isn't going to change shit with the leadership they have, hasn't ever in over 40 years.
