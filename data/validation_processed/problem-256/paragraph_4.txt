The division of votes in the last election was between far-right and centre-right parties. The left vote was not of serious consequence, and it hasn't been for years now. Lapid might have had a better chance of staying in government if Labor and Meretz had tied up together, but they will next time, I'm sure. Everyone, doubtless, is preparing for another election already, so we'll see what happens.
