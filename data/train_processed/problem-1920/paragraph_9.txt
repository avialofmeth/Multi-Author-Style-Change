I'm reluctant to believe that one since he was returned directly to his unit within Ukraine, whereas a prisoner swap would have sent him to Russia, not directly to his unit inside Ukraine.

It sends a worse message to Russians who are thinking of defecting -- that Ukraine will not honour their defection and will bargain them away for POWs, after which they will be executed by their own country.
