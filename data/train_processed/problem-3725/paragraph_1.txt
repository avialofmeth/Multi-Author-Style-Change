Generally speaking there is usually records of prominent things, but by records that could mean something pretty enduring like stone carvings, stuff a bit more fragile like articles written on paper/papyrus, and then verbal records through stories or songs. And unfortunately historically literacy wasn't as widespread as it is now, so the most prominent sources of information was probably the spoken word, which is liable to be forgotten after generations or twisted and muddled after a centuries long game of telephone.
