better get all your shots in now, the idea that nukes be hosted in ukraine to ensure lasting peace is something I think will get serious consideration, if the army is beat back and nukes are installed, then this will never be able to happen again, unless you want to pay the price of getting nuked for it, ukraine had nukes before, imagine how good they'd have now if they kept them. We should have never taken them away. Was very unfair to them. It was good to have that nuclear deterrence. Of all the ways to ensure ukraine won't be invaded again this is the most sure way.
