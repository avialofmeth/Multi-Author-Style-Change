He isn’t running for President because he’s trying to avoid jail. There are easier and cheaper ways of getting that done. He could grease a few palms and have his whole Mar-a-lago looney bin made a legal voting booth. And you can’t arrest someone while they are in a voting booth. You think this isn’t possible? People thought it wasn’t possible that he’d be the president either.
