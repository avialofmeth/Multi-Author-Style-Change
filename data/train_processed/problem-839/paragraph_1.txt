No. My mum voted to leave because she wanted ‘to take back control’ over our borders. I asked how that was going with all the immigrants crossing the channel in small boats and she blamed France for not stopping them. When I pointed out that we had ‘taken back control’ now and asked why we couldn’t use that control to prevent this happening, she stopped talking to me. Logic is lost on them.
