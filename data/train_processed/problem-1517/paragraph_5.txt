Biden should step aside when the time comes and let someone else run. He did better than expected in the midterms, but I don't think he can beat DeSantis in 2024, and that's all that matters.If he steps aside he can go out on top. He doesn't seem like he'll be fit to be President in 2024. Aging is hard, but it's a part of life.
