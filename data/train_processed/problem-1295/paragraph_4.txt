Florida will immediately override the law. The teenager will get the guns and do the mass shootings they were planning on, and Republicans and irresponsible gun owners will shrug and say “nothing could be done about that, maybe we should focus on mental health but not fund mental health resources”, and then Republicans will scream about how Democrats are coming for your guns. It’s a tale as old as the current NRA.
