DeSantis plays every fascist trick in the book. Anti intellectualism, anti communism, "anti communism", culture wars, sowing doubt in democratic systems, overbearing machismo and toxic masculinity, racism, queerphobia, what-aboutism out the ass, and covering any possible topic to distract people with bullshit, the paradoxical dual beliefs of his enemies being weak, unpatriotic, unamerican, and less than human, while also telling people that they're threatening to take everything they hold dear with the power "they" have, it gives his supporters the sense of constantly being under siege on all sides, by potentially anyone and everyone. Ron DeSantis represents the greatest threat to American democracy in a long time. And Florida just reelected him.
