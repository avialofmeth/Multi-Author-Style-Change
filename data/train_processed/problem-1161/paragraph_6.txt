Would it be too much to ask that the US donates a handful of older A-10s to Ukraine just in case the Czar sends another long line of cannon fodder. I am certain the old dudes that designed and sold the A-10 (50 years ago) thought of exactly the scenario we witnessed. Where the Czar railroads ended they would have to use road and be eradicated. I wonder if the ancient A-10 has a way to slow down the rate of fire so they can erase many kilometers of the Czars cannon fodder.
