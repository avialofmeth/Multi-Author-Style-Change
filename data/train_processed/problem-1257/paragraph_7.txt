I'm a Democrat - always have been. But our system of government works best when there is a _healthy_ and civil tension between competing ideas, but with a common goal of upholding the Constitution. That doesn't exist right now. I'm reminded of the relationship between Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan. Politically, they fought like hell with each other, but after hours, they could both have a drink together. I can't imagine that AOC and MTG doing that, in large part because MTG has no inclination to work across the aisle or respect anyone with a differing point of view.
