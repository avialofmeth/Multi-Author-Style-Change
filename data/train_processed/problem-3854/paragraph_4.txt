Rewatch that scene, after he asks for a million he gets laughed at by everyone because it also wasn't much money back then. Your reaction to the phrase (it's not much money) is literally how the world leaders felt in the movie, and he DID up his asking price. That's why someone replied whoosh to your original comment - that was the whole joke in the movie.
