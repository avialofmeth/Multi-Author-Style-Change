Edit: sorry, at the time that I posted this I didn't have my morning coffee yet so my brain wasn't exactly working lol. I meant to say that if the workers were to strike now, they don't have legal protection as union members from being fired. They can still strike, but if they get fired they have no protections in place to protect their employment. I still think they should do it, but this move disincentives them from striking.
