Let's face it, the US has outsized power and will use it aggressively. Sometimes for very good reasons. Sometimes for really petty and emotional ones. The US has the best military in the world and can put it anywhere they want, and they will do so for decades at a time even when that's not a good idea. The US has the leading world economy and is so interwoven into so much of the global economy that the 20% or so GDP badly undersells the influence the US has economically. The US also have a dizzying array of global alliances so that you're never facing off against just the US either.
