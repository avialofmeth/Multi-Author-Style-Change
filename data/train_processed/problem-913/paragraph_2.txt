This is a really important point. I don’t think anyone in the GOP is angling to actually have a Putin someday, largely because Putin occasional “defenestrates” the richest and most powerful oligarchs from time to time. But there are other authoritarian, “neo-fascist” dictators that the GOP mainstream idolizes. I think Hungary is almost the exact prototype that the GOP is trying to mimic here in the US.
