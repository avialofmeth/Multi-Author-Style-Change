Gazprom started reducing the flow of gas to Europe after sanctions were implemented for the Russia-Ukraine war. They shutdown their pipeline to Poland in April. Then they reduced NordStream 1 flow to 40% capacity in June. They said it wasn't their fault, citing a faulty part from German company Siemens. Then they reduced it to 20%. By August it wasn't delivering any gas at all, while they claimed they needed a turbine sourced in Canada that presumably couldn't be released due to sanctions. No one actually believed that the technical problems warranted shutting the pipeline completely down. Yet Gazprom offered to start running Nord Stream 2 under a new contract instead (which would only be able to deliver at about 50% capacity). Germany balked at the offer and procured the turbine needed for repairs. Russia refused to have it delivered.
