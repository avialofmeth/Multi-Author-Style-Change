Most of the cost was building a new city, airport, hospitals, etc... which are long-term investments. The stadiums themselves make up only very tiny portion of the reported 200B budget. Also, most of the money is just being redistributed between various royals Quatari royals who own all the companies being paid, its not like they paid 200B to outsiders or to the workers who built everything. Sure, the foreign engineers made bank, but the vast majority of the budget is just redistribution of wealth between branches of the royal family.
