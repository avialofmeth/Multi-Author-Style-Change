We have mandatory service for 2 years for all healthy male adults below age 27. Exceptions are made for those who pursue education (bachelors, masters, etc.) and those who have at least two kids. However, some may go to military bootcamp for 2 months (I think), but it is available for fixed fee ($1000, maybe more) and for man above age 24.
