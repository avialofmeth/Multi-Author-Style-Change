The easiest argument to make is this: Socrates never wrote a word down and most of the works involving him are written by Plato and Xenophon. Plato’s Socrates is clearly a literary figure used to say things Plato believed while deflecting blame. While I believe that Socrates taught most of what Plato records… I have no historical reason to. Jesus is a similar case, but his teachings were recorded and spread by hundreds of personal friends and at least 8 of his closest students.
