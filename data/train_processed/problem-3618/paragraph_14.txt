He destroyed real faith in American democracy, I think, so obviously he’s deep in the negative category on the whole. But at least he was a singular character acting as an actual leader, trying to make the country into his vision for it and fighting hard for it. His vision for America was mostly nightmarish, but I like to imagine that it’d be possible to elect another person like that, but good; that there is a potential for real change through politics. Every president that has followed him has failed to overcome being much more than a figurehead on top of the corporate leviathan. The best we can hope for now is just a figure who oversees a slight course correction for one of the parties.
