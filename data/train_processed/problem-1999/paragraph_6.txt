I said "by many accounts", not that I really believe it. To be fair, I didn't really think about US politics during 2016 elections, so I know very little, but I think that the fact that she recklessly used private server to manipulate confidential documents doesn't compliment her prospects of president very much. I've heard that she was actually super hawkish, which is why Trump appealed to certain new or liberal voters more and why exactly is TPP good thing? Wasn't it just a outsourcing deal that costed her many Rust Belt voters?
