Man, the dems just don’t get it. They don’t get it at all. The GOP is not going to play by your polite rules and traditions, they’re hear to overthrow democracy and install an authoritarian Christo-fascist government. I wish the dems could just learn to fight back, play dirty, fucking show some backbone and save our country. Every time something like this happens we’re supposed to be upset at the republicans - again. And again. And again. We need the rational party to start operating with way more aggressive attacks, save the fucking country.
