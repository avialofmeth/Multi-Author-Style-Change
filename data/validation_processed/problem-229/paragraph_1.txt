It doesn’t make sense for china to outlay so much capital and manufacturing knowledge to a neighbor that has the potential to be a peer down the line in decades time. I don’t see them making the same mistake the Americans did. From India’s point of view it doesn’t make sense to let a greater power, especially a neighbor grow its influence in its country via capital and relationships if they intend to compete with that country for similar goals. India is completely fine with other foreign nations doing it because the foreigners have made it quite clear they are willing to play ball with India in attempt to prevent any alliance or severe dependency between India and China. If india can get just as much capital from foreigners and looser terms because the foreigners have realized they need India as an ally or at-least to remain neutral, why take huge capital outlays from a competitor that lives next door?
