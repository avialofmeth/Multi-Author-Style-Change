And before anyone goes "But the Arabs refused to sign the agreement", of course they did! There were no representatives from the Palestinians brought to the table. The Israeli's had people sitting at the table representing their interest. They had lobbyist groups fighting hard to push for the creation of Israel. And at the end, they got like 90% of what they wanted, where as the Palestinians got nothing other then being told they had to leave their land that in some cases their family had lived on for hundreds of years.
