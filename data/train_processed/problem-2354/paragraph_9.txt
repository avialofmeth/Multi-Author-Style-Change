My father remarried after my mother died, and now I have step-family in Redding. Not that I didn't used to spend summers in high school working on Lassen county. The northeast of the state might as well be in Idaho. Not all that different heading south along the Nevada border until you get to the Mojave Desert. I forget if Obernolte's district CA-23 includes Palm Springs. If it does, that likely explains his Yea vote.
