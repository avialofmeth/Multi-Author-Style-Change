I’d say even more. Having grown up in the south with eligibility to join the Daughters of the Confederacy, most people who flew it 20 years ago didn’t even think of racism. It was pride for where they came from and mourning the general loss of the thin veneer of “Southern genteel life” fantasized about in days gone by. It literally didn’t occur to them that it could be seen as racist. Some people only got a clue when a Black person told them what that flag meant to them. Some people still don’t get it. Usually because they’re morons who don’t get a lot of things. And, yeah, some are outright racist, just as our Confederate ancestors intended.
