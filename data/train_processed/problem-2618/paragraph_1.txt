Remember Benghazi? Hillary's E-mail scandal? In both cases Repubicans did much worse then Democrats, George W Bush has many comparable attacks during his presidency compared to the singular Benghazi, and regarding the E-mail scandal, previous Secretary of States like Powell behaved similarly to Clinton, and Trump's very own children continued to use their personal e-mail accounts for government business during Trump's presidency, even as they shouted out "Lock her up" for the very thing they were currently doing! Yet, despite that, Obama has a Benghazi scandal, and W Bush does not, Clinton has an E-mail scandal, and Trump along with his children do not.
