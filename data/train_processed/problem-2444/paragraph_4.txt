My conservative family does it all the time when condemning all criminals and druggies yet making every excuse for my cousin who is a meth addict. When it's them or someone they know, they're capable of looking deeper than surface level and developing an understanding of the situation. When it's a stranger the analysis is superficial and they are categorized with whatever stereotype is appropriate.
