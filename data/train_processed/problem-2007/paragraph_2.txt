Though I don’t think it’s the end of missile strikes for today yet, as just recently there was a second missile strike aimed at Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure, and apparently it wasn’t done by an S-300 missile, but a cruise missile, which they usually do not use on Kharkiv, because they can use the cheaper and more abundant S-300 missiles for it. Some people reported electricity being cut after that missile strike, but for us it’s stable for now. We had it the entire day with basically no interruptions despite the missile strike, though it did flicker for a couple of seconds right after the first missiles landed in Kharkiv in the morning.
