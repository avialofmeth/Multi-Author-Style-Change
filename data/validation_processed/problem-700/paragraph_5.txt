Castrating the High Court with no constitution or any other mechanism to rein in a potentially corrupt legislative will mean Israel won't be a democracy anymore--as far as democracy is actually defined, which requires: suffrage, 3 branches of power (judicial, legislative, executive) with separation of powers implemented, a free press, human rights to prevent suppression of voters, and as a KPI of sorts for how well it performs: the transfer of power.
