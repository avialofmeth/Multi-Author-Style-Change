If it weren't for the emails, she might have entered office with bigger majorities than Biden started with, and with the election serving as a bigger repudiation of Trump than 2020 was, so I wouldn't have been surprised if she not only got the SCOTUS liberal and got some decent stuff via reconciliation but also managed to succeed where Obama failed in 2013 and got a comprehensive immigration reform compromise passed. Plus maybe she'd have pivoted again and pushed for TPP, which would have been a good help in trying to contain China.
