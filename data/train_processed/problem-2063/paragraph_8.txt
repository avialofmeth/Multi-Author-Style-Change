They'll still call it "democracy," but it will just be fascism wearing the democracy's death mask. After that, voting will decrease as democracy goes into a death spiral, because at the point it truly becomes rational to say your vote doesn't matter (an impulse I definitely do not plan to ever acquiesce to, but can't deny will become logical), more people will stop voting.
