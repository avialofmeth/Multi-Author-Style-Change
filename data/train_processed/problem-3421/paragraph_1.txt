We won't. The Doomers were wrong in the 70s claimed that hundreds of millions would die and they're wrong today. That's not to say that nothing needs to be done but things need to be done and they will largely be done (even if they are not done in the best way). Most people will not starve, starvation generally comes not from agricultural production but from broken political and economics systems that are okay with people starving. See Colonialism and Communism.
