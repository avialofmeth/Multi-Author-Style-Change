Swiss animal rights lawyer Antoine Goetschel sees the petition to ban cat and dog meat as more symbolic than serious. "It forces the public and Swiss politicians to take these issues into account," Goetschel told Newsweek. Goetschel believes that "companion animals are entitled to more rights than other animals" in society. A petition like this will allow us to ask questions about the rights of all animals, Goetschel says.
