It's not though. Taiwan alone accounts for 65% of the semiconductors and 90% of the advanced chipsets manufactured worldwide. A large scale conflict in Taiwan causing manufacturing stoppages would cripple the global economy. It would make the multi-year chip shortage caused by covid look like a mere hiccup. Not to mention that if China were to gain control of those factories, they would then have the ability to inject whatever spyware they want in those products natively and create mass security threats in electronic systems everywhere.
