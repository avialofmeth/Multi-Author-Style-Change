Yes, you can cut doors and windows. The containers are literally designed to carry load at the corners. You can remove something like 80% of the walls and it wonâ€™t reduce the strenh at all. The side walls just reduce deflection of the side rails but if your stacking containers, the loading is carried through the corner post, not the side rails or walls. Sure, if you land a large point load in the middle of a container side wall it will deflect more, but this is a stacked container wall.
