It's leadership does not have enough stamina to account for all the rapes and stolen washing machines. Yes, not all Russians are barbarians (i know some amazing people from ru), but a very significant part of population is exactly like that, thus we can say country is basically composed of barbarians. Especially since most sane russians already left their country after all this nonsense. So do not put the blame on leaders, because ultimately leaders derive power from the people. There is always more people than police/army/leaders, there is always more power in hands of people. They just need to chose to exercise it and pay the price necessary for freedom.
