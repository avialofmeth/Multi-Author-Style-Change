The worst part is that this plays right into the Swedish right wing agenda, as the fascist party "Swedish democrats" recently finished second in the election and have a lot of influence on the newly formed center-right government. They are well-known racists, with high-ranking members previously supporting and attending Nazi events, and they want reasons to cleanse the country. It's even better if the pressure is coming from outside, so they can blame it on global politics. In the 1990s, one of their goals was to deport any migrants who arrived after the 1970s. Although their strategy has since changed, to be more subtle and less extreme, their views on the matter has not. So while it may look like Sweden is bowing down to Turkish politics, in all honesty I think it serves the Swedish fascist parties too.
