So it was not police just doing whatever, it was a court ordered removal. If the court didn’t say ‘and let the media stay’, then ‘public’ means everyone. Not to mention that CGL had filed civil charges against her (later dropped) for being there during the injunction. Especially in BC, there’s no “we can trespass on your property and yell ‘media’” option.
