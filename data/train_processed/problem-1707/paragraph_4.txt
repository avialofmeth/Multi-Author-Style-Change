Additionally, poor people are more likely to retire younger due to poorer health as they age. Which is the inverse of what you implied. To be clear, this isn’t their “fault”. And I hate the idea of making elderly individuals work for longer, especially in manual and industrial jobs. But I’m just trying to set the record so people can have a more informed discussion about the issue instead of brigading what looks on the surface like a simple social injustice.
