honestly I would say it is close to impossible, imagine you are being fed propoganda on tv, in the office no one talks about it, your son died in the war, and you expect them to denounce the war and admit that their whole way of life is wrong and they lost their child for a blood thirsty dictator's crazy delusions? Naturally I am not justifying their POV, just trying to see it from the perspective of the average russian boomer that doesn't know about VPNs etc.
