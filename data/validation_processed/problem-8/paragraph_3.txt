As I understand it Bout was a monster, but one that served Russian interests, so to them it was helping someone on their team. It's also not a popular trade so they enjoy that it undermines the White House's PR. It's unlikely they expect Bout to go back to business, his value is purely to be a fly in the ointment for American diplomacy.
