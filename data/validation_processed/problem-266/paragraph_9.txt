Can't you say that about Ukraine too. The world loves to act like it cares but the lives lost are Ukrainian lives. And all that aid is really just loans. And those weapons aren't unconditional, they are using Ukraine for real life testing without riskung they're own citizens' lives. My prediction is that repeating WW2. Sell weapons to the fighters, wait for them to weaken and attack eventually when they are beaten down. War is terrible.
