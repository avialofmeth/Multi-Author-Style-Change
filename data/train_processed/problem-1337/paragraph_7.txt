It hurts them most of all The froggies didn't make anyone poor, they live in the marshes I'm starting to think that these idiots just scream 'froggies, froggies' and hope that's all people think about. They've never even talked to a froggie, or the torties, or even us I bet when they stub their toe, they still shout 'those damn froggies'".
