E: Sarcasm aside, what you're talking about is a fundamental change to a 200+ year old system. I have worked for gigantic corporations in the past and currently do as well. Even with a unified leadership and a clearly defined plan, they tend to make aircraft carriers look nimble, so a significant change, even with full buy-in, takes a long time to execute. That's with an S&P 400 company. The country is exponentially larger and is far from unified in terms of leadership and the population. It would be generous to call what you proposed a concept when it's closer to fantasy.
