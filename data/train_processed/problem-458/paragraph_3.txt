Trying to see this from a Republican's perspective, why exactly should I NOT want to shitcan Ronna ROMNEY McDaniel ASAP? She's presided over how much losing? Granted most of that losing is much more Trump's fault than hers, but timing is valuable, and she timed her rise so terribly that it screams her lack of useful political instincts.
