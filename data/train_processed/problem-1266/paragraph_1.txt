Hungary is even worse, Russia at least has most it's imperial lands and wasn't a consistent loser since 1850. Hungary is a shadow not only of it's former self, it is a relic. a small leftover of a once massive kingdom and political hegemony. it is a country that isn't increasingly irrelevant, it has been irrelevant since the revolts in 54. it made a big deal out of migrants and refugees since that was the first time in decades that they felt important. it hates the EU since it reminds them just how small and weak they are, hence why they are flirting with great powers a continent away since it gives them warm feelings.
