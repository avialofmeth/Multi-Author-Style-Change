Maybe I’m being pedantic...but I’m pretty sure he didn’t survive because of the condiments (saying he survived on them implies this). He would have been starving since the condiments would not be enough to sustain him, people can go a month without food, it just happened he had condiments which gave him a small thing to consume while he was starving. So, the ketchup company is just using this as marketing opportunity. This guy survived on his own and they are spinning it as their product is the reason he survived.
