I feel like this doesn't help that, either: "Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church allegedly demanded that the priests of the UOC–MP deny Russia's armed aggression, talk about the "oppression of the Moscow church" and other Russian propaganda narratives. The SBU has charged the diocese’s clergy with high treason.".
