You have that wrong buddy: the majority of the rail union workers voted against ratifying the agreement on the table. Once the agreement was rejected, the rail refused to negotiate further forcing the adoption of the rejected contract. That's why this strike was proposed. The main thing that the workers fought for was a few days of unpaid sick leave.
