Get more or less gifted some of the most modern weapons systems available because they all joined NATO and are considered trusted allies in exchange for dumping some ancient gear and reinforce the position of the "fuck you Russia" bloc. Wins for everyone but Russia. Fuck Russia. The Russian military is a failure that can't win without resorting to terrorism and scorched earth policies. Garbage.
