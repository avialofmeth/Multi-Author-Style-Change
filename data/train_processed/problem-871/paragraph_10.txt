Russia knows very well that they can't strike Ukraine with a nuke, even with a fabricated story (Russia would lose support from two big "allies", India and China) and NATO would decimate Russia's military in a few weeks time. But I agree, Ukraine needs to destroy any Russian nuclear weaponry they can find.
