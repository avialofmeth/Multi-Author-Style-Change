Some commentators and political veterans like Rick Wilson keep suggesting that "pain is the only teacher." By this, my take is the only thing that would induce the most pain would be getting voted out of power for a very long time. Then, after a long period of reflection and a new generation conservative thinkers and leaders, they can begin the process of becoming relevant again.
