Should have never said anything about calling Trump on the 6th, Kevin, and you certainly shouldn't have acted as if he had some responsibility to call off his murderous mob. Should have made sure that every person who may have overheard you was ready to fall in line no matter what, but you were all in true peril, so even in that building, it might be hard to find a decent sized group who'd keep totally quiet in those circumstances.
