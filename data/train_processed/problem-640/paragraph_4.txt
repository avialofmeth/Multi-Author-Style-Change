It seems that the current Peruvian constitution has a clause that congress can impeach a president on the grounds of "moral incapacity" which its vagueness effectively allows Congress to push forward impeachments due to the subjectivity of the phrase. (Since the last 3 presidents have been impeached by Congress, the latter has effectively become more powerful than the presidency).
