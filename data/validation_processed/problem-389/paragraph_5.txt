“Twitter poisoned” people act like bratty 10 year olds in an online game. Musk just spent two weeks being a juvenile in public, opening Twitter up to all kinds of damage (legal and technical). They couldn’t stop the Chinese government from spamming the coverage of the protests, and he is bragging that sign ups are at an all time high. It’s bots, moron.
