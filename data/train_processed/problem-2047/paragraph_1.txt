Honestly I don't think you're entirely wrong, the Panther has only been in development for 4-6 years (components since 2016, system level development began in 2018). So far, they've been using the tried-and-tested Leo 2A4 hull, layered in passive armour, reactive armour as well as their modular APS panels on top, so only the turret is really new - and feature like a launcher for loitering munition and such.
