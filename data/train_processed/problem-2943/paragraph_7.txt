Edit: I think I misread something here. I was thinking about Fox being liable for all of the election lies and Jan 6, for some reason. If we are talking about the Dominion case specifically then yeah these texts are devastating. They show awareness that the lies they were spreading were, well, lies. Anyway, my bad.
