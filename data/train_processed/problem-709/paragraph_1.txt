I wasn't sure if it was Eisenhower but I knew it was pre Reagan. If Eisenhower were to run today supporting strong labor unions, and speaking against the military industrial complex like he did, he would be a dem. it's crazy that a republican from the 50s was more for labor unions, and against military spending than either party is today. The country has shifted so far right in the last 70 years it's hard to even recognize the post war 1950s society compared to today.
