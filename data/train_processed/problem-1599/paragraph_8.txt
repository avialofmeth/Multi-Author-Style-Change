It still amazes me that after a doctor gave him a dementia test while he was president, in which he had to identify that a drawing of an animal with a hump was a camel and that a drawing of an animal with a long neck was a giraffe, trump subsequently went on TV to brag about how he had been able to correctly name the animals.
