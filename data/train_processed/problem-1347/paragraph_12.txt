If the peace plan entailed that Russia would retreat, it would say so specifically, using language referring to mutually established borders at a certain date. Otherwise, the statement has no value. The Chinese peace plan essentially says: "Stop fighting now" which would freeze the borders at the current line of conflict, which would be hugely beneficial for the Putin regime. They get to keep Crimea, Mariupol and most of the southern coastline of Ukraine. He can sell that back home as a win. Especially as we see that it's gearing up to be Ukraine's turn to go on the offensive this spring. So any freezing of the lines of conflict, currently massively favours Russia.
