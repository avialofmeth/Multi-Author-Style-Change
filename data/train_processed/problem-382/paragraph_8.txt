Consrrvative media and figures are sort of hedging their bets a bit, imo. They are allowing shit talk of Trump, allowing some people to say he is a personal non grata, and talking up DeSantis, but mostly remaining silent. They are seeing which way the winds blow by election day, while slowly propping up the candidate which can be controlled and they want to win (desantis).
