C S Lewis thought that the people in hell weren't locked there. He thought they locked themselves in. He wrote a book called the Great Divorce which is about a bus of people from hell that went to visit heaven and were offered the option to stay. They all chose not to, because of the way they became in life. One guy didn't want charity and wanted some way to earn his stay, and out of principle wouldn't stay for free, for example.
