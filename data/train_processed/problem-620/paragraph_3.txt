I hate to say this, but what would prosecuting the Prince even look like? How the fuck would they get him into court? It’s shitty, but if prosecuting heads of state was as easy as just announcing their guilt, things would get complicated fast. I hope this bastard gets what’s coming to him, but this was never going to happen the way people wanted it to.
