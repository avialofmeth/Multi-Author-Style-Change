Does anyone truly believe the missiles were Ukrainian? I mean sure, they could have been, but this whole scenario is clearly "NATO desperate not to go to war with Russia," so the truth is basically irrelevant. The missiles are from Ukraine because NATO needs them to have been fired by Ukraine, regardless of where they're really from.
