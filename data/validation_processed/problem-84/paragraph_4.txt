The vast majority of people I went to school with were good people and are doing good things now. You get shitty people from anywhere and they all find ways to succeed. Just because someone went to an Ivy doesn’t make them bad and just because someone went to a state school doesn’t make them good. Wall Street pulls from everywhere and they are equally bad.
