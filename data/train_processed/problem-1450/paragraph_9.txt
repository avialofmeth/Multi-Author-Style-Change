Don't get me wrong, I am not against sanctions. I am against sanctions that harm people that have pretty much nothing to do with the war. These "financial weapons" can be controlled not to harm these people. Except that we don't know much about who decides whom to sanction and how they make these decisions which can be pretty dangerous.
