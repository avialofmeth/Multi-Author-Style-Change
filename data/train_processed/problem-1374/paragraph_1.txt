Cassidy initially went with a Trump world attorney who was not working on her behalf and refuses to sign an engagement letter with her. He advises her to not reveal anything she doesn't have to. She reaches out to a mysterious unnamed Republicans congressperson who advises her to do what she thinks is right. So she secretly asks the committee to have her back for a third deposition so she can come clean about details without her attorney knowing she alerted them. Also the entire time, her attorney is finding future employment for her as well. And while this was going on the campaign was literally paying her living expenses. She finally dumped him after he advised her to stop talking and risk prison time not for her benefit, but for Trump's.
