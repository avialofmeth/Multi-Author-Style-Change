Pete is progressive and he gets things done. When all the mandatory processes are finished he'll have overseen the largest improvement in passenger rights ever. This rant from Bernie's former staffer is the best evidence why "progressives" are mostly useless. You have to understand what you're regulating and what can actually be done, not what you'd think would look good to your supporters or in the media. Throwing a fit and imposing fines on airlines without the necessary authority and due process would do a lot of harm and no good at all. That's how DJT tried to rule.
