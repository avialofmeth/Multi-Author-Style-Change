It is great how this article doesn't even answer this question. Either way, though, you should probably allow voting to continue for a single extra hour if people keep showing up. It's like if you are GameStop at a midnight release. Are you just going to tell the next group of customers that they are too late to buy a game on release day or are you going to stay open? Why wouldn't the government have that same view. "We're still here, come on in!".
