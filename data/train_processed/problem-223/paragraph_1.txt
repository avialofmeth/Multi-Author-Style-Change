The real answer: you'll still have to pay the tax, because contrary to popular misconception, social security is not a savings account you put money into during your working life and withdraw when you retire. The money you pay in gets redistributed to the current recipients, with the expectation that in the future, the next generation will pay for your benefits, etc. The Republicans aren't trying to end it immediately, they want to cut it for future recipients, so current recipients (aka, boomers, aka, their voting base) won't lose their benefits. It's a classic ladder pull.
