Yes it's pathetic i quite agree, but to be fair they have more artillery pieces than you can count, shitty Chinese knockoffs of soviet Era...but alot of them are trained on Seoul, it would literally pancake that city...besides nukes it's there only real threat, seriously they could flatten that city and would if war ever kicked off...pretty scary thought.
