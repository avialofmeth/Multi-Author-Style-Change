His "ability to maintain good relationships with western powers" is BS. He oversaw the third cross-strait crisis. The only reason you don't remember the times he disagreed with the West is because we never took China seriously as a potential peer competitor. Back then, we could silence China's disapproval of a Taiwanese leader with a basic naval exercise. Jiang and Xi's policies towards the West haven't changed, most of the change comes from the West not being as cooperative because it realizes China is an imminent threat to it's hegemony.
