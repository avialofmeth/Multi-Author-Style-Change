Among all the things proposed in the reform there is only one good thing: to give less money to political parties (a lot of money is allocated from the treasury since there are about 8 different Mexican political parties, and frankly, it's silly to give money to all of them when only 2 or 3 are popular in every election), however, this is the fallacious argument used by the government and through their bots in social networks: "Are you opposed to the reform? It is because you are classist, you oppose that politicians stop receiving money, surely some relative of yours benefits from this", when in fact we criticize more aspects of such reform, not only that particular aspect.
