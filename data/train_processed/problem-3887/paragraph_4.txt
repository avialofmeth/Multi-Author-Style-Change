I agree that Romania, Slovakia etc should have the same sized deployments as the baltic states but the reality is Ukraine already shields the south combined with the fact the baltic states have no strategic depth like Romania, once the baltic front lines collapse they literally don't have enough space or time to reconstitute them hence the focus on protecting them from possible aggression.
