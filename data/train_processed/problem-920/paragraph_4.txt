When the political unrest in Michigan was so bad around the pandemic, we (my husband and I) invited my transgender neighbor to stay with us (even though we were in an apartment complex) because we had two guns and we would be safer together. He took us up on that for a few days because even in the middle of political unrest about COVID vaccines/shutdowns, they still found a way to target Transgender people. I felt unsafe on his behalf. It was disgusting what was being said, even in what was basically a college town.
