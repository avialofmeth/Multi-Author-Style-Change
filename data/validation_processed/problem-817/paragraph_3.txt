Kazakhstan does this a lot. You can get up to 17 years for suggesting to overthrow the government. A post promoting acts of terrorism will land you up to 12 years. Other stuff like instigating ethnic conflicts or if you offend someone's religious beliefs - that's up to 7 years. Publicly criticising government officials is up to 5 years. Offending, slandering, calling names... up to 2 years...
