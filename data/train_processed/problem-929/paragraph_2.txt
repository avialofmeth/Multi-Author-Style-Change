It's really strange how the right is completely split on the balloons, half view it as confirmation that we really are under attack (true in a sense) while the other half are denying it and think it's something related to project bluebeam (a conspiracy theory about aliens). It's incredibly dumb and is why the American right cannot win because they can't even agree if Chinese balloons are real or that China is a threat.
