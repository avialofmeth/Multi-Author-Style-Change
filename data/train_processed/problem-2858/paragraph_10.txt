The bottom line is that even with the old maps, if Democrats get the most votes, they control the House. With the new maps, they have the same opportunity and with greater theoretical proportional representation advantages compared to the prior maps. If we end the midterms with less votes for Democrats, will we really blame the courts for them not keeping the majority?
