The metals they are mining are called Rare Earth Elements and the technology to extract them from all ready mined coal tailings. I live in the same county as this test mine and all I can tell is that the place is thriving. I drive by the old Dotiki mine everyday going to work and everyday the facility is bigger for has more sophisticated outside equipment (lots of chemical bulk storage). Whatever they are doing, the government and private sector are rewarding them with funding to continue. Ain’t nothing doing nearly as well in ol’ Webster Co.
