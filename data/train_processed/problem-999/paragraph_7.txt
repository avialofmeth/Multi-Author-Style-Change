Judge McBurney agreed with her and ordered that only the parts of the special grand jury which didn't list any names be released. I linked his order above. Also, if we believe what this juror is saying in the OP about more than a dozen indictments including recognizable names, that probably includes DJT, Giuliani, Meadows, and maybe even Lindsey Graham.
