Saw pictures of the tank crews getting off the plane this morning. Idk how to explain it, it’s just so surreal. Best way I can put it is it’s sort of an in your face reminder that ‘this is real and it’s happening’. I had the same reaction to the article that the US will bring up to 100 Ukrainians to Oklahoma to train them on Patriot systems.
