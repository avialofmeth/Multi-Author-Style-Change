If she would've just lived with the fact that she had been lying to her employer about her hours worked and been fired quietly, they never would've pursued her for the measly $1500 as it's likely more costly than that to pursue her. It's not more costly however to just respond to her case with the facts and have the tribunal order her to pay their costs and $1500.
