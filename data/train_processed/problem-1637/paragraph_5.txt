Funny thing is that he Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church were strongly anti-witch burnings. Those happened overwhelmingly in protestant nations. Not saying that there weren't wackadoos. I mean the Malleus Maleficarum was certainly written by a Catholic, but only the Anglicans had a "Witch-hunter General".
