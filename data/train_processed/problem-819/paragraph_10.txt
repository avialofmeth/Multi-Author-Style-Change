We had some crazy shit going on but Polish people generally are distrustful of our governments so it was not all that hard to brush it off and assume it was at least sorta similar in Russia. Suffice to say that for instance we had a simplified Visa process for Russians (same as with Ukrainians and Belarusians) meaning we did consider them a potentially good workforce that's easy to integrate.
