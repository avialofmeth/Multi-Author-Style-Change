I stopped using Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014 - which was so long ago, and much corporate name changes ago, so Ill repeat the gist of it, Facebook was selling the pyschological profile of millions of Americans to a shady corporate project that helped right wing, fascist and racist corporate allied political groups micro-target ads to effectively brainwash (they called it advertising) the moron millions into supporting insurrection. Fack facebook, fack meta, fack Zuckerberg and my life was better after I stopped using facebook anyways.
