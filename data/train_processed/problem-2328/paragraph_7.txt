Where this gets interesting is that the design philosophy of strategic nuclear weapons changed over time, moving away from a “single big bomb per target” paradigm to a “multiple overlapping small bombs per target” paradigm. More, smaller bombs does more damage and makes it harder for a defender to shoot down the re-entry vehicles. But it also means more points of failure.
