I never said we can't criticize, but we have to be aware that we too are installing dictators. For example Iraq is one of the most corrupt countries in the world despite being under US control, as was Afghanistan. If we can't even deal with corruption under our own watch then we create the conditions for a change of power in favour of our strategic rivals. It's easy to convince people to turn against us if we are providing them a raw deal.
