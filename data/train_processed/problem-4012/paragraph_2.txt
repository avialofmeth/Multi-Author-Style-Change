The problem is that Canada isn’t independent from the British crown, it’s only independent from the UK parliament and prime minister. It’s still part of the Commonwealth and Charles is nominally the head of the government with the Canadian prime minister and members of parliament answering to him. So not swearing an oath of allegiance to Charles III is like refusing to take the constitutional oath of office in the US. You generally don’t get to take your seat in congress if you refuse that oath.
