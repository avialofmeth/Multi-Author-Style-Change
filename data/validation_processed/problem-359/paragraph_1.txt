My theory is that aside from the ego boost she got from making like Arizona's answer to Evita Peron speaking in front of adoring crowds, Kari might also might not have been as financially set for life as one might think after her long career as a 'star' anchorperson in the local TV news market in Phoenix. Maybe she lived beyond her means or got into some bad investments. This overnight conversion to MAGA politics might have been a cynical money grab for her.
