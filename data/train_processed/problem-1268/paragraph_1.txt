We’ve gone over this so many times over the last 6-7 years. It’s infuriating. He’s not a new person in politics. He’s exactly like all the other rich aholes that get involved in politics. He double speaks, lies, and often gas lights you over what he said or meant, but the thing is he’s not that good over it because he flip flops even in the same interview! So frustrating when dealing with people who have tied their identity to him, so they can see how their cult leader might be wrong.
