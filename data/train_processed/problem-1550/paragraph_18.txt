Is this your only point? The UK is not in a position to supply the heavier weapons that Germany wants, not that I'm against this. However, right now, Kyiv explictly wants tanks, the most appropriate tank for them to recieve is leopards by a college mile. Also, can you source this for me? I want a reliable source on the UK having comitted less than half of Germany's by GDP, and I hope it accounts for all of the training that both countries are doing, as well.
