What about this is imperialism? Can you explain to me what power the US is leveraging against the Phillipines to force them to give the US base access on their sovereign ground? This seems like a transactional arrangement where the Phillipines gets military assistance in the region with their consent and stimulus to local and national economies as military personal spend money in the region. Also they are hedging their bets when China and its illegal fishing trawler fleet has violated its internationally recognized EEZ. Fucking tankies man never even do basic research onto these subjects.
