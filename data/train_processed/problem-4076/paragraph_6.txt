He doesn't have to, he just has to let Trump beat himself. Something he's done in the past 3 elections he's been in or around (2018, 2020, 2022). DeSantis isn't Jeb!, he isn't Rubio, he isn't Romney. He isn't a milquetoast neocon that the Republican base doesn't like and wants to be rid of. Assuming that Trump will do to DeSantis what he did to the people the base wanted rid of in 2016 is willful self-deception and if it becomes the mainstream Democrat position is going to leave everyone scrambling by the general.
