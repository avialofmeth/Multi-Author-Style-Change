Not that I'm aware of, but the quality of troops their fielding lately isn't much better than a conscript. They're the group that was recruiting from Russian prisons. They also advertise across the country and offer even generous pay by American standards, up to 5000 USD a month. "Up to" aounds dubious because Idk what a soldier would have to do to see that number, but it no doubt would be very attractive to a great number of people in Russia. They even advertise as no combat experience needed, which is not what you want in a mercenary company.
