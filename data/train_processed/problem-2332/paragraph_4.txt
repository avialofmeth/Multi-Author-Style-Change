When I voted yesterday, it was one of the most cathartic votes I've ever cast. Removed from my psyche were the 6 months of doomsayers and talking head's babble. It took only a few minutes to vote, but yesterday PA voters sent all the clueless doomsayers, ginned up GOP polls, talking heads, and one pos carpetbagger packing.
