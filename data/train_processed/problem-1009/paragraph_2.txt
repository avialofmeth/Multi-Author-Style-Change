There’s actually a lot of good stuff in the Quran, especially for the time period it was written in. The problem is that it’s a religious book, and those always have fucked up bad shit alongside the good so it’s basically a net neutral. That, and like most religious books it was written over a thousand years ago, and none of them are really fully compatible with modernity.
