You mean he reluctantly agreed to do what the house, senate and infectious disease experts were begging him to do a month earlier. All he literally did was sign a executive order declaring a emergency to allow the house the funds to help the pharmaceutical companies to rush the vaccine. Literally any president would have done the same but likely earlier. The fact that he takes credit is hilarious.
