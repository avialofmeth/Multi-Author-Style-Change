What's crazy is that Russian nationalists will say Russia CANNOT LOSE. That Ukraine being whole and independent would DESTROY RUSSIA. Germany was actually destroyed, occupied, cut in two, lost a bunch of territory. It is now the leading political and economic power in Europe, far more prosperous and peaceful than it was when it was a "mighty empire". These nuts are so obsessed with guns and bombs and "real politik" that they're ignoring the reality right in front of them.
