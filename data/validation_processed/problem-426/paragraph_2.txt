I think another reason might be that ISPs stopped supporting them. I had temporarilly cancelled my internet when I moved across town. A month or so later, I reactivated my service. I couldn't connect with the NNTP server so I called CS. The guy I talked to literally did not know what I was talking about. He claimed to not know what Usenet or an NNTP server were. I mentioned newsgroups and he insisted that I could read news on multiple sites such as CNN. At that point I gave up. I just read that I can access them, but am unwilling to pay for another subscription. The ones I have bleed me enough as it is.
