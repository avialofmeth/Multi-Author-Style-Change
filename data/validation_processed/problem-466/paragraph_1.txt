its like the modern digital environment, it was intentionally designed in a particular way which feigns personal utility while utilizing you for ulterior motives. The only way through this now, is to start from the ground up and give that springboard for everyone an actual foundation instead of the trap tarp covering clown dunk tanks the GOP ensure our government puts in place of social services. Moving the threshold into personal goldilocks zones of political security is how we are where we are, its not a real structure but a laminate on the damn wrapper of sovereignty so nobody even realizes the tarp is a trap with a specifically designed clownshow under it and nobody stops talking about the next carnie showcase to see what we can do about the fuxking tornado that stole kansas, Dorothy and her little dog too.
