For us younger folks (think millenial) it was a "well, they did some crazy shit in the past but it's not like it affected me personally". We did not harbor any particularly nasty feelings towards Russia. Our parents kinda did (communism was... weird but not as brutal as you might otherwise think it was, at least for typical citizens) and our grandparents DEFINITELY did but you certainly did not hear schoolkids saying they hate all Russians or something, it was just part of boring history. I mean at the same time you also got to see German concentration camps (and hear the stories on how they turned people into soap) and apparently Germany is okay now so Russia should be the same, right?
