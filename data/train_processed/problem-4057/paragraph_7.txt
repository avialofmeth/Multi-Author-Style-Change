Has the Department of Education claimed this relief is a “modification to” the 2003 law though? I’m not sure what that means. I’ve only read that their argument is the law clearly vests Secretary Cardona with the authority to edit and discharge debts in the event of a national emergency, the pandemic being the reason invoked.
