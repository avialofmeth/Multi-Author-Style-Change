You’re ignoring the tax rebate received that covers shelter, food, etc. and actually reduces the tax burden on lower income families who spend most of their income. This comes as a monthly payment of a certain amount made to households. There’s also no tax on used goods including clothes and vehicles. It’s not as straightforward as that but could be a progressive solution. It’s akin to taxing wages and wealth. Most of the super rich aren’t paying income tax as they don’t do traditional work so avoid paying like the rest of us. It would tax purchases of the rich and make tax evasion nearly impossible. Tourists and those making money illegally also contribute to the tax base, spreading the tax base. I respect that you don’t support it and your concerns are valid, but reading the full bill may help alleviate some concerns.
