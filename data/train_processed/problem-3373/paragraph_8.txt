If the goal is a widely learned, preserved language, you can't teach with dozens of different dialects and expect anyone to care. The kids on most reservations can learn their local language if they want. But good luck getting anyone to take, let alone certify, the curriculum of a high school or college language program anywhere else if you can't find someone outside of those few square miles of rez that can say it's correct.
