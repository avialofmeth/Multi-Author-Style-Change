Cool. But the reason all those people were on staff is so complex. Frankly, elon has proved himself to be kinda a simpleton in terms of his actual understanding of business. Those employees might seem extraneous. But then since that's happened Twitter has had a MAJOR data breach, they've had issues like the one in this thread, they've had internal complaints and frustrations. They had a scandle where they had to ask employees to bring their own toilet paper to work?? This is all disastrous for a billion + dollar company.
