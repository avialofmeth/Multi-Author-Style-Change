I don't fucking forget and ignore the shitty behavior of the GOP because that was 2 years of legal gridlock and obstinace at every opportunity that made anything we as Americans tried getting done in Congress an exercise in hot air. They are the biggest fan of locking everything down to get their way, and that's anything except serving the interests of the American people.
