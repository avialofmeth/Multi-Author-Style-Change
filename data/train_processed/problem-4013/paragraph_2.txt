Bullshit. Luka sold his country to the devil to save his own ass. Remember that he called Daddy Putin for help to be rescued from the 2020 Belarus protests after his own people were tired of his dictatorship. Putin "helped", alright, but Putin's help has a habit of not leaving after overextending its welcome. The "Russian invasion" Luka talks about already happened, Luka just surrendered without firing a shot. Putin tried pulling the same shit in Kazakhstan in early 2022, until he was kicked out by China (the irony... even Xi is tired of Putin's imperialist aggression.).
