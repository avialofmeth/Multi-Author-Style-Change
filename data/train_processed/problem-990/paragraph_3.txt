Currently Prigozhin would probably take that power but in no way it would be peaceful....there aren't any real competition against him if Putin kicks the bucket. Gerasimov and Shoigu have no way to gain any power after their farcical invasion...but still there remains high possibility of civil strife with chance of fracturing.
