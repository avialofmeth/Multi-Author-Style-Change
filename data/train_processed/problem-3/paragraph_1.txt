I've never seen the supposed Elon-Simps in the wild so this a first for me. To be fair though the article you linked gives credit for the accuracy to GIS Arta - which yes Starlink is currently providing the internet that lets it work- but its a bit disingenuous to claim that it's all because of Starlink. In addition the other dude has made a bunch of points about Elon's other very serious detriments to the Ukrainian cause and I would say its probably a wash right now? Maybe a bit less?
