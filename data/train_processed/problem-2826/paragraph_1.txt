Yeah Russia, Iran, China (must be more) but any country actively oppressing humanity should be ostracised dealt with derision, smited and shown the error of their ways. China is the most difficult to deal with. Some ways my money goes to China are not even in my hands. Here in the UK much of the UK water supply is owned by foreign countries and you can't choose your water provider here. Anyway I can give less money to the CCP is a win for me. Fuck Xi Jinping and his oppression of Chinese citizens and Uighurs, Fuck Hitler Putin and Fuck religious clerics who enable imprisonment of women protestors who are then married, then raped then killed. Can't tolerate these regimes. Can't keep down the people who fight against these evil tyrants.
