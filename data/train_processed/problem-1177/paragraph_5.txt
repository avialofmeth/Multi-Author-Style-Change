Agreed. It's very telling because it directly contradicts this narrative that the mainstream GOP has moved on from Trump. If that was actually true, then hosting a neo-Nazi for dinner would be a great chance for them all to uniformly denounce him. The fact that they're all remaining quiet shows that he's unquestionably still the Republican party's standard bearer and the leading nominee for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
