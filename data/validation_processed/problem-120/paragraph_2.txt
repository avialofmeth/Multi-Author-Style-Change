Wow, this hits home. I lived in Taichung for 4 years about a decade ago. I've actually been to this bar a few times, but never had issues there. There is definitely a weird vibe in Taichung bars, for some reason. I always heard stories about gangsters taking offence that some white guy had tried to dance with one of their girlfriends and beating the hell out of every foreigner in the bar as a result. "White guys cause problems" might be the other side of the story, though. I doubt the bar will be able to get away with this for long.
