While true, this is incomplete - a tenant of the Druze religion is cooperation with whichever secular regime rules the country they are currently living in - Druze living in Israel are loyal to Israel, Druze living in Syria are loyal to Syria, etc. The Druze started the war of 1948 on the Arab side, but quickly saw where the winds were blowing and switched side. This was to protect their communities and religion.
