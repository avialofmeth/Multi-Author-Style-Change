"Faces up to 3 years in prison" means "under investigation to determine if a crime was committed, and if so, the maximum penalty for that crime is 3 years". As far as I can tell, no charges have been filed, it's entirely possible this does not qualify under Norway's hate speech laws, and even if it is a crime, there will likely be a much lighter sentence than 3 years of prison, which seems to be the absolute maximum penalty for hate speech in Norway.
