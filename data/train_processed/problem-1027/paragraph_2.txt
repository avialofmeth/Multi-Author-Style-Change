On January 26th, Meduza was outlawed in Russia. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office designated Meduza as an illegal, “undesirable organization.” Officials announced in a public statement that Meduza’s activities “pose a threat to the foundations of the Russian Federation’s constitutional order and national security.” That means we’re banned from operating on Russian territory under threat of felony prosecution and any Russian citizens who “participate in Meduza’s activities” also could also face legal repercussions. Me, for example.
