Well, I would say that I have know some women who prefer not to talk about their relationship status at work, but they don't care outside of work, but the majority of women I have met have been very open about having or not having significant others. Have I spoke to men that see hookers? Sure, but I don't like that kind of man very much, and I try to avoid that kind of person.
