Take Stalin, for example. His death triggered essentially a de facto coup. This was because his means of control, which was to keep many people in competition for his favor, necessitated that when he died, these men would have to fight to replace him. In that sense his regime ended when he died, because no one could continue to play his role. A lot of what Stalin did to keep himself in power was to remove any ability of his administrative state to function without him.
