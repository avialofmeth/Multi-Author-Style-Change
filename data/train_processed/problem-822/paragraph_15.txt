In order to get those optimal charge times you need to precondition the battery, and get the battery warmed up meaning you need to drive the car around for half an hour before you charge it. If you are already driving around and have the sense to do that that isnt a problem. The issue becomes people getting up and needing to go somewhere and needing to charge their vehicle with limited time on their hands. I know plenty of people with EVs and now this is already a reality. Needing to select where they are going to charge the vehicle in a menu option and it becomes really convoluted.
