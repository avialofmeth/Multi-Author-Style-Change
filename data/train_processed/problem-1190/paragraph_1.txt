It's very likely the Brits and the Americans had something to do with that, since Kolomoisky was a big proponent of the Minsk accords and when Zelensky turned on Kolomoisky, he also did a 180 on that issue and became extremely pro Nato practically over night. Keep in mind one of the key issues for the Zelensky campaign was being a proponent of a Minsk style solution, which is why at the time he was portrayed as a Russian stooge by a lot of media outlets. It's also why Scholz and Macron dislike Zelensky so much, as they negotiated the Minsk accords and they essentially believe Zelensky was paid off to change his stance right when it seemed like a done deal.
