Maybe, but the Galwan valley incident happened in 2020, way before the current Ukraine conflict and Russia's reduced standing. I'm pretty sure they're aware of how hard a Himalayan conflict would be as well, and honestly I still don't even know what the result of the earlier skirmish at Galwan was. According to India they killed more Chinese soldiers while according to the Chinese side they killed more Indians. I'm slightly more inclined to believe India, but it's not as though India's government isn't also pretty nationalist - but at the very least they gave us numbers, unlike the Chinese government refusing to even do that. If what India says is true, I would think the Chinese wouldn't be dumb enough to make an even bigger push on that front now.
