It's a little deeper than that. They propped their currency up with gold and forced all olagarchs to convert their holdings to their currency. This created a "foreign currency reserve" within the banks. Wartime production seems to have barely ramped up, but also seems dependent on foreign materials which are sanctioned. Troops are shipping with less and less gear, soviet reserves have drawn down to the point they are sending armored vehicles built in the 60s and 50s. Air traffic from the military has drastically reduced and my aviation mind tells me it's likely due to engine maintainance issues (usually the first major components to go that truly ground aircraft).Couple this with the rumors leaking from soldiers on the front lines to cut ammo expenditures by more than half and you have a picture forming. The next mobilization will likely remove a large chunk of economic supporting production. The impacts have been mitigated by pushing off the effects to a later date, they will hit hard, but later. They can't reproduce losses, doing so would likely quintuple military spending, which would draw those reserves down rapidly. Think of it like a spring winding up, they are going to have to relieve the tension and show economic deflation or keep winding until it snaps.
