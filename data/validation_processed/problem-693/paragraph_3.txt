It's even more interesting since Putin can't just devalue the ruble to settle the budget like before. Hydrocarbon exports are down, gas sales have dwindled and the Ural is being sold at 40% the Brent. OTOH imports of sanctioned or self-sanctioned goods are already overpriced. Plus all the hoops to get trade flowing, evading sanctions and whatnot.
