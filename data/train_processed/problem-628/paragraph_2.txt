I can’t imagine that the average Palestinian is happy with Hamas being in charge, but they have a lot to lose by speaking up. People who try to organize against Hamas have a way of being branded with one crime or another, and dontcha know… the penalty is always death. Sometimes the families are leveraged, but it’s never pretty.
