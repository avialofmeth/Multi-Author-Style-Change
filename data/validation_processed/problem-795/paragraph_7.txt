You must remember, it was the Soviet Union, not Russia, that spent 10 years fighting in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union was a much more powerful country than modern-day Russia and losing all those people and money in Afghanistan helped lead to the Soviet Union breaking up. Losing 26k people and a ton of equipment in Afghanistan broke a wealthier and more powerful country than the modern Russian federation.
