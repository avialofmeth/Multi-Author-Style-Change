You only think people are "good" because you lower your standards to those of the people you already like. I won't lower my standards - I shouldn't have to, especially considering everyone holds me up to standards they could never live to themselves. Why do you all get to beat me for not being perfect yet I can't do anything if you don't live to any standards at all?
