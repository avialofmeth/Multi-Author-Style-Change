I think what made the dike burst was Russia's second mobilization announcement. They're really going to try to flood the region with bodies in 2023, and it's given the West a sense of urgency that wasn't there before. They've got a window of probably about 6 months to arm several powerful Ukrainian mobile armored brigades and train those units for a big push.
