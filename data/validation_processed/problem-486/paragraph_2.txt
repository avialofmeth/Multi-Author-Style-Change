Even power outages in Ukraine might be less severe than in areas of NK. Can you imagine what their reactions will be when they enter places that are still largely intact? Food, services, basic conveniences? When you can get shot for watching a western movie in NK(if testimonies are true) - the chance to live free, to escape, and be hidden as a “ casualty of war”? I’d be screaming, “take it Defect and fight for Ukraine” I’d bet on that being the better choice by a mile.
