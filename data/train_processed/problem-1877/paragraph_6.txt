Yeah, really only private woodlots (which are becoming a thing of the past, thanks Irving) do selective harvesting and the vast majority of Canada does clearcut logging where everything including non-commercial timber species is clear cut, then they drag everything up to the roadside and what isn’t sellable timber gets burned in large oxygen-starved fires. I’ve done forestry work in three provinces, ON, BC, and NB. Don’t let anybody tell you Canada has a sustainable forestry industry.
