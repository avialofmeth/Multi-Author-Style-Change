OP ---Then they should also have a taser built in and cellphone that has two way communication. Get close to the geo fence it vibrates. Stay too long a 1 second shock. Leave the geo fence shock every minute and the ankle bracelet contacts the monitoring service for two way communication. Don't give your password or explain your situation like I'm in an ambulance heading to the hospital shock every 15 seconds. Don't contact the PO, try to cut it off or get inside to the base terminal to pair it with in ten minutes blows your foot off. Enter a no go GPS location like a ROs address everything happens. Don't like the options then go sit in jail.
