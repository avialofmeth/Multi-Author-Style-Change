I actually quite like IPAs, but I have had some Norwegian and Icelandic ones and they were awful. I like other beers from those regions, but I have yet to drink a tolerable IPA from outside the US. There's some sample bias there of course, since when I'm somewhere else I tend to drink whatever's local which is usually not an IPA.
