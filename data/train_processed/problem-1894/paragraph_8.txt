Intentionally taking boxes of classified documents and hiding them all over your house, letting known foreign agents onto your property during that time, then lying about having given them back not once, not twice, not three times, but four times with the help of legal aid(who now must get their own legal assistance), fighting the FBI and the national archives on their retrieval at every step over the course of multiple years, claiming they have been declassified with your mind, sending some to your uncleared staff who backed them up on the cloud and sent them in emails after shell gaming them around different properties - is a little different.
