Russian strategy relies chiefly on bluffing. Now that there's a knock down fight, that posturing is revealing the true weaknesses of Russia's military. It is a paper tiger at best. There is no logistical supply chain and the equipment is inadequate and the training virtually nonexistent. The leadership is also either inept or too tied up on political constraints that they can't develop actual strategy due to being micromanaged by politicos.
