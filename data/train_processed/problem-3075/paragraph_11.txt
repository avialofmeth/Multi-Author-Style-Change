Ya. I was wondering if it missed anything. I saw coverage of these ads when they ran and it was clear this was just talking about the stance these candidates have taken. The ads even run as a warning about these candidates. Then I saw coverage of dems “boosting” far right candidates. I thought they were talking about something else. I don’t really see how these ads are considered “boosting” those candidates, unless they just mean boosting their profile.
