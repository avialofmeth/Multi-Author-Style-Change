More over it was the idea of them. The fact they were designed to be high and least the idea of them to intentionally make German's feel guilty about the war. It was a weird feeling because the war wasn't on German soil and it didn't feel much like a crushing defeat to every day citizens yet the negotiated peace was quite punititve. The Nazis were able to leverage this alongside propaganda like the Stab-In-The-Back myth to convince people they were betrayed by their elites and they didn't actually lose and that Germans should be proud patriotic people. anyways we know how the rest goes. So yes the reparations were responsible but in a less direct way than imagined.
