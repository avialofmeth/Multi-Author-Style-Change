Imports of Brazilian meat (i.e. exports of our meat) are one among the two biggest drivers in new deforestation, as we already have enough cattle and farmland to feed our entire population. Exported Brazilian beef reached sales of almost 10 billion USD in 2021. Soybeans are the second major culprit too, but it's basically only China that buys them at massive scale (70% of our soybean exports go to China, totaling 38 billion USD in 2021), and it's hard to spread awareness there.
