If i remember correctly they already found some dumps/stockpiles with them and they had Chinese writing.(hence the "chinese is supplying russia rhetoric") but it wouldn't be something China has stock of, cause its from decades ago and hasn't been used by china for a while. Just like USA doesn't keep stockpiles of old outdated, discontinued ammunition.
