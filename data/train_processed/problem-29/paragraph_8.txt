That's definitely not how our system works my dude. I do in fact have influence on what happens to representation outside my district because that's also a separate function of the State that I live in and I have multiple avenues of influencing that, from voting for a state rep and or senator, to the governor race, to referendums. And of course I can donate both time and money to influence races outside of where I live, and holy shit do a lot of people do that too.
