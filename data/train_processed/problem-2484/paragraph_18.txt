BUT to publish the tapes themselves as a whole, as a separate thing to purchase (is that what happened?) clearly would be an infringement unless Woodward has a contract (written or not) that says otherwise. He might try a "First Amendment" defense, but especially since he apparently SOLD the recording that's unlikely to work.
