Hilarious that these idiots still cling to the idea of small government when every Republican since Nixon has expanded the federal government’s powers. Same with fiscal responsibility. The deficit balloons under Republican presidents. It’s all a joke. They’ve got nothing to offer except tax breaks for the rich and self righteous anger. That’s it.
