Hot take....Musk wants to kill TS and knows it will happen if/when Trump doesn't have the self control to not tweet. To him, unblocking Trump from Twitter isn't an ethical issue, but primarily a business decision. He wants TS users to migrate to Twitter but doesn't care about the political, ethical, or moral fallout from forcing Trump into this position.
