Seriously though, RepubliKKKans need to get it through their thick skulls that the Constitution isn’t just a license to say whatever, whenever you want, and to be lying seditious assholes who constantly run roughshod over the law, commit acts of fraud and terrorism, and foist their religion and bigoted, abhorrent, fascist ideology on everyone else. We have a lot of freedoms in this country, many of which the GOP is hypocritically trying to undermine, but those freedoms are neither infinite nor applicable in all places at all times. For a group that loves- or used to love- to claim that it’s for “small government” and liberty, these GQP clowns sure are trying to interfere a lot in how businesses act and who is entitled to liberty.
