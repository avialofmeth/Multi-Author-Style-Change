So the fact a higher rate of Black people are prosecuted for crime isn't evidence that Black people commit more crime. In truth most crime goes unsolved. Rather I think it could be argued that Black people are simply more heavily policed because of stereotypes. As a result of being more heavily policed Blacks are more likely to be prosecuted and or killed by police.
