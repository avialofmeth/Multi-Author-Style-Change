Perry represents the Harrisburg area in south-central Pennsylvania, which has flown to the left in recent years. In 2022, Perry's opponent got very little national attention or money, and didn't have a big-time campaign. Perry only won by 7.8 points - close enough that a better-supported challenger could take him out. This district also would have voted for Trump by just 4 points. While I don't have the numbers in front of me, I believe Democrat Josh Shapiro won it in his race for Governor. It's completely winnable.
