They don't care but this amount of death and injury is in the long run unsustainable. Every single dead soldier is going to not only need to be replaced but most likely all his gear, weapon, and any equipment they were operating. Losing 500-1000 men a day is going to eventually cause the public to no longer support the war, it hasn't happened yet but it will.
