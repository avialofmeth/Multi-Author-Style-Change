Why does the word chamber get used just because there's torture involved? Can it not just be a room? It feels reductive and trivialising to start throwing around terms like chamber in some weird reflex to using the word torture. Like it makes it feel unconsidered. "Torture chamber" is just a term that you mind reaches for and uses and can gloss over. Torture room, a phrase more in line with how people actually speak, gets more at the truth of the matter, and doesnt derails things by conjuring images of medieval castles and shit.
