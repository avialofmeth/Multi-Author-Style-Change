So, I guess Russian tanks are actually pretty cheap a T-62 is only like $300,000 and a T-72 is only $500,000 - $1.2 million, this is what Wikipedia tells me at least. I used the Oryx blog and Wikipedia to calculate how much money all the destroyed/damaged/abandoned/captured costed Russia. I did not include the unknown tanks in the cost.
