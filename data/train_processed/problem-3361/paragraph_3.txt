Interesting how the article's giggest claim had already been corrected and acknowledged officially before this article was published. The other claims against him seem to rely on a bid of mental gymnastics to indicate Biden should use a different context, or include data that would offset his numbers. Overall, a bit of a dog's breakfast of a fact check article, stressing minor exaggerations at best and that the vast majority of Biidn's citations are correct. Definitely written with an agenda.
