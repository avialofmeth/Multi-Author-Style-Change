If the headline wasn't heavily editorialized (which it is), it would have worried me. It is one thing that a head of state is afraid of the consequences of using nuclear weapons in a scenario where more nuclear weapons could be used as retaliation (a completely legitimate fear, in my view). It is an entirely different thing that the FSB, an organization that controls the Russian deep state and is full of far right nationalistic elements, characterizes their own leader as "afraid" of using nuclear weapons, because that would mean that whoever succeeded him might be tempted to show the bravado of bringing us towards the end of the world just to keep his own clique in line.
