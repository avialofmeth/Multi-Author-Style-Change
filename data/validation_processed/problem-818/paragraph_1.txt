Capitalism is inherently flawed. Regulatory capture, for-profit lobbying and geographic barriers ensure that perfect competition cannot and never will be a thing. The market does not tend naturally to perfect competition; instead it tends naturally to monopoly and price-fixing which means that any capitalist system requires constant vigilance and correction - and gives a huge incentive for companies to engage in regulatory capture.
