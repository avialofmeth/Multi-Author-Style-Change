Depends on if it was a repurposed s300 being used to hit a ground target or if it was a kalibr missile. If the debris is an s300 then debris alone won't tell you who it came from. There's also a very real possibility that it was fired by Russia but in the interest of de-escalation, this is the story being told. It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to publicly state Russia fired a cruise missile killing Polish citizens if they don't want to escalate because of it.
