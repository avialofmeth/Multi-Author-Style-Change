"more than 30k". Interesting math. They had IIRC 52k prisoners and 32k mercenaries. 31st of January the whole Wagner group was 28k, including just above 7k prisoners. 135 prisoners were granted Wagner pardon completing their contracts. About a thousand received their pardons for heroism on the battlefield. That leaves 43k prisoners that aren't accounted for and not a single prisoner returned to continue his sentence (that's the rule when they are signing up, btw). So at least 43k people from Wagner group wasn't able to return to fight. I think that's the definition of casuality.
