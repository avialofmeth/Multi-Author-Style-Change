While Musk would actually be dumb enough to try, he can't actually force anything. DeSantis is just spewing shit trying to get fascist voters attention, per usual. I doubt he views this as much more than a publicity stunt, like pretty much anything he does. Think Martha's Vineyard without the human trafficking 'issues'. Good red meat for yall queda.
