The first step is always education. When you get a mass exodus of people out of a highly propaganda managed state, there is always some latent psychology that needs to be addressed before they can break the cycle. It’s a fairly recurring there on the North Korean border that defectors have a hard time adjusting to the speed of motion in south korea. Many will go back. Psychologically it’s probably no different than an abusive relationship. Toxic..but familiar.
