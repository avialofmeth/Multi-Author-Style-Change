Haha, I actually applied for a job as that with a certain agency years ago, about a year out of college, but they wouldn’t take me because my mother was a foreign citizen. I’m actually just a high school teacher and historian now. I just happen to know a bit of Russian and have followed this conflict decently closely since 2013, as well as some related events like Savchenko Incident.
