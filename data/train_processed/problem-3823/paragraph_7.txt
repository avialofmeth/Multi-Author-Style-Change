Except that's what it's literally designed to do? The entire pack can be removed and replaced in a few hours. Shipping it to another country may not be ideal but it does allow for servicing it without Ukraine having that capability while still having the tank itself be available after a one day downtime. It would certainly be a better situation than what is currently happening with some systems which have to be shipped in their entirety like the PzH 2000.
