I read it back when it came out. It was completely unsurprising and totally in line with republican hypocrisy. I really donâ€™t get it. If they actually got what they wanted they would be bankrupt. I guess they think that they can pick and choose? I spent a lot of time in rural areas, and while I am white, I speak Spanish functionally. Every little bar in ever shit town that I went to for a few beers, wings, and a game of pool when the day was over was all Latinos. From Texas to Nebraska and others, Same.
