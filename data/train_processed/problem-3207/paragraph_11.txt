My dad loved to talk about the 70s and 80s. To him that's when time should have stopped. In big as well as small ways, it was like he couldn't accept that time had moved on. Young people looking at smartphones, women and POC being in the workforce and more educated than him, self-checkout in the grocery store...it's like somehow all of it made him feel awful. You could sense that he no longer felt comfortable in the world and that he only felt safe in the nostalgic bubble he created in his mind.
