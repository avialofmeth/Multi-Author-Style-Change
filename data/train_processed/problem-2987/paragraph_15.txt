I think you are losing sight of the original comment here. I’m not arguing that progress has been made and will continue to be made. I’m just saying this is nothing for the war efforts. They will save some gas and oil, but the fact remains that the high amounts of rain is temporary. I’m excited for a world of green energy, and know there are so many ways that we can improve wasted energy collection. But this massive decrease in oil reliance is due to a natural phenomenon, not a constant. Solar is far from being our savior currently, very low efficiency, but every month there is another breakthrough is solar technology, years away from production ready. Wind farms are great at generating power, but rely on the proper land and conditions and can cause damages to ecosystems if not done properly.
