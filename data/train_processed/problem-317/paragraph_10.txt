I think he will have a tough time winning the primary. The backlash to him post 2018 / 2020 / 2022 losses is pretty solid. Hell even /r/conservative was dumping him across the board on election night and plenty of GOP senators are speaking up about how poorly he is performing so could be interesting. Either way it's gonna be a vicious primary and I cannot wait to watch it.
