I'm glad that they are protesting wages. At my current institution, undergraduate students are paid minimum wage, graduate student workers not much more, and there are staff members who qualify for subsidized benefits because their pay is so poor. Librarians with two graduate degrees are sometimes started in the high $40s or mid-$50s and are still expected to teach, serve as academic advisors, and so forth, in addition to serving in their primary roles. Administrators, on the other hand, are highly compensated, and tuition is raised year after year. One year, administrators passed out chocolate bars to thank faculty and staff at the holidays, but didn't give any raises or days off.
