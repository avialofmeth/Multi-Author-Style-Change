The drop in popularity(not my opinion, this is from various op-eds) ATM is due to 3 things, this is the first time we've had a non-coalition government since we switched to mmp and they haven't done half the things they promised, inflation and there's a crime wave rn and the left always appears soft on crime compared to National(leading right wing party) in nz. I don't think her having a kid has much to do with her popularity at all.
