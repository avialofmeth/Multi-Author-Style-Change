As a gay man living in the deep red state of South Carolina (minus the Columbia and Charleston areas), I’m happy that something has been passed… even with both my senators voting against it (no comment on Lindsey… we all know what I’d like to say). However, it’s still sad that if Obergefell gets overturned by the Supreme Court, my state has a trigger ban on gay marriage. I’d need to leave the state to get married. It’d be recognized in my state now because of this bill, but it’d be nice if I didn’t even have to worry about that.
