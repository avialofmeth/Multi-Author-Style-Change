Not just emigration, but pronounced emigration of technical and scientific individuals, who are more likely than the average citizen to reject state propaganda and not hold any patriotic sentiment towards the war in Ukraine. These individuals emigrate at a higher rate given this attitude and by also having higher wages which gives them a better chance of getting out of the country when plane tickets skyrocket in value and officials look for bribes. The Russian population won't just be ageing, it also be getting dumber, and the central Politburo that desperately desires Russian advancement ahead of the West technologically is the same Politburo that has ensured this will never happen. Not to forget that this isn't just a loss to Russia, it's a gift to the West, when you think historically of how great Soviet engineers and scientists have been. You're not just losing them, we're getting them.
