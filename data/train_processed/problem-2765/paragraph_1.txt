Highly disagree. If the priority is to virtue signal and not to affect positive change, then that will work, and will alienate lots of potential voters that otherwise might vote for good things. It’s obvious that Christian fascists are a huge problem, and they will not be convinced they’re wrong, but there are lots of Christian fence sitters that aren’t into the extreme cruelty that WILL take the statement as a personal insult because the media they listen to has ammo to spin it that way. Is it better to yell at fascists or to defeat them?
