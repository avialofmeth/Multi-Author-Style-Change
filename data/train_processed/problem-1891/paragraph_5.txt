Here's a big issue - cities and people in cities pay like 90% of state taxes that are collected. But who runs the state is not decided by popular vote or by share of taxes paid. It's decided by gerrymandered districts that heavily favor rural areas who pay just a little bit of the taxes. Then those lawmakers decide how to spend those taxes, and refuse to put enough money into the cities to keep them running well.
