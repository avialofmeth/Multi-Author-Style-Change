As you’ve probably heard by now, while Santos did not, in fact, work at Goldman Sachs or Citigroup, he did work for a company that was accused by the SEC of orchestrating a Ponzi scheme. That firm was called Harbor City Capital, and in a deep dive on Santos’s time there, The Washinon Post spoke to several people whom Santos pitched, including one who described their meeting, which took place at Santos’s favorite Italian restaurant, as being like a scene out of Goodfellas. That same would-be investor said that after their meeting, Santos frequently messaged him asking when he was going to invest, later exploding with anger when he declined.
