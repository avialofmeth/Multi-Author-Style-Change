No, Mastodon is a completely different concept. It is not hosted by a single company. Instead, it is hosted by many different servers. So, you only need to join one server (with a distinct domain name) and you can see the contents of all other servers that are connected to Mastodon. If you don't like your server, you can migrate to another server with a completely different "local" community. Just move your data over to a new server. So, essentially you have a local community and a global community.
