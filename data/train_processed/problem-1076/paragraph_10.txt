In any case, the failures of Russia in Ukraine are largely due to piss poor logistics, training (at the officer and enlisted/conscripted level), morale, and corruption. If tanks are ordered to advance unsupported and get destroyed, it's not an indictment of the tank. Same as if it runs out of fuel and is captured.
