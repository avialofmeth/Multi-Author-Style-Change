I know plenty of kids in high school, totally aware of the danger. All been told or read about it. They just don’t care. The need to get likes or do a stupid fucking dance like a village idiot, is just stronger than the fear, or care, of being tracked, influenced, or hacked. Don’t care, hands down have said to me, who gives a shit, it’s cool. What’s worse, Ukrainian soldiers are using Tik Tok to make videos. They’ve already had drone operators dying because fucking DJI who make the drones, gave their software to Chinese Government who gave it to Russia, so they can hack into the video feed of the drones, locate the pilot, lob a bomb on their heads. It’s just a matter of time until (if not already) Tik Tok give Ukrainian troop location tracking to Russia.
