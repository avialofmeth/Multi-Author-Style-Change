Fundamentally though, the government is still committing cultural genocide to this day. Sure, kids aren't being taken to TB-infested boarding schools, but their education remains completely Western-style (not to mention nearly all post-secondary institutions retain white colonialist structures, methods, and knowledge). Kids no longer need to cut their hair, but they're still largely trained to think and act like good European subjects, which is arguably the more important aspect of culture (rather than aesthetics).
