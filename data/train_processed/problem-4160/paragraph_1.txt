But the Iranians protesting won't accept that. It isn't an economic movement, it's an anti-regime movement. There have been numerous protests over the years and plenty of opportunities for the regime to soften their stance on particular social issues and they haven't done that. If anything they've tightened their stance on social issues, for example becoming much more strict with the hijab law after the current Prime Minister came into power. No amount of economic relief will change that. We don't know if the regime can be toppled by these protests, but that's their aim. They're well aware of how violent the regime can be, but for them it's a risk worth taking.
