You're just regurgitating outdated claptrap, America is absolutely not a federation of states and we don't act like we are. We're one country with particularly annoying internal divisions, but we're definitely one country. The previous assertions that states were able to do what they want has been adjudicated, the morons that held that belief were shot.
