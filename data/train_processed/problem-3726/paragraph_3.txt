Governments don't really matter because most people don't understand how supply trains actually work. They streamlined the precursors for alot of things out of China or India just like alot of countries do. Why? Because it was cheaper and faster then making an industry at home to source it or they didn't have enough companies local to meet demand.

People need to understand how much money and time the global economy as a whole spent making this smooth working tango of cargo ships and shipping schedules that make it possible to get that new kitchen blender you wanted. Then it got a massive heart attack because covid and it will take a decade to sort out.
