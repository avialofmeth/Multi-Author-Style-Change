Only ever knew one person IRL that had pages pass through their hands and that was the term they used. A few hits of the trimmed off perferoated edges of a sheet was also one of the most visual and transformative trips I ever had (much aside from the visuals could be ascribed to it also being a very transformative time in life moving from manual labor to grad school, as well as a beautiful sunny day off work due to expected rain storms, I still have a sneaky suspicion that really fresh LSD is a lot more visual than older doses though).
