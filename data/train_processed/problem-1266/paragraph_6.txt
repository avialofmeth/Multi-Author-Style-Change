I feel like as a Hungarian I have to chime in on this. From all my friends, relatives or Hungarian people that I ever spoke to, no-one has ever expressed even remotely similar mentality to what you describe here. There never was a point during my 8 years of history lectures when we learnt that Hungary was a great or significant country. It was bigger than now in terms of territory, but not "great". It's just a very poor translation.
