Haha I live on a giant cannabis farm in the mountains on the coast. I can fuck who I want without any complaints, I can do drugs and at best get a $100 ticket for having a ball of cocaine (I don't use just an example of freedom), and the local gas stations almost all have biscuits and gravy I fucking love living in the west.
