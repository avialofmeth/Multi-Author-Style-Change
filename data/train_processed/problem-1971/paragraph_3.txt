I'm just saying that as an American I wouldn't even have mixed feelings about our team forfeiting as a matter of protest. It's the morally right thing to do at this point, but also, we suck at soccer relative to our normal performance in athletics, and so it's not like we would be sacrificing sports achievements by protesting. I also like the (hypothetical, of course) opportunity to stand in solidarity with our European friends.
