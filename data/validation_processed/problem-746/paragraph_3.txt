We are already tired of this shit, a lot of Crimeans have left for Ukraine, someone has moved to Russia, the local population is disappearing and being replaced by Russians from Moscow who have a lot of money, which locals consider to be slaves. Why pay more? All these places are occupied by visiting Russians, housing is being built for wealthy Russians, and local people work for 20,000 rubles ($ 300 per month). Of course, many new "Crimeans" (Russians) will be against joining back to Ukraine, since there are already half of them here. They came to us under 1 million from Russia and they are afraid of losing their property that was bought cheap or taken away by force from locals.
