Not sure where I saw it, but was watching an interview of one of the Ukrainian officers explain why things had slowed down. Firstly he cited the weather changes but he mentioned that the influx of Russian mobilized has absolutely caused them problems. Yes, they're not trained very well, and poorly equipped. But it's still an enemy you have to go through, and they do shoot back and call in artillery. Despite the moronic comments flooded on reddit, these Russian mobiks do have guns, ammo, anti tank weapons, APC's and armor. And they're killing Ukrainians with them.
