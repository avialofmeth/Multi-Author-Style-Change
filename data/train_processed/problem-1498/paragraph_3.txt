Not you, personally, but the British as a nation. You had gotten guarantees from China, and had sort of promised Hongkong - but then the UK was so busy and weakened with Brexit, the pandemic and Tory infighting, that they just stood by when China assimilated Hongkong. I heard that their new school textbooks don't even mention the time of the British occupation anymore - it's just another part of effing China now.
