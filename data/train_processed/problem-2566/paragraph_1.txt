was thinking about this issue earlier today coincidentally, and I agree in principle that the Indian Nations should have their own votes and representation, but then again don't they kind of do already? Native Americans are US citizens with the right to vote in whatever state they live in. Arizona would never have gone blue if it weren't for the turnout from the tribes. Deb Haaland is Pueblo and she's Secretary of the Interior and was a congresswoman for New Mexico before that. It's a weird sort of disenfranchisement, because they're not disenfranchised as American citizens, but the Indian Nations themselves are disenfranchised as sovereign entities within the country.
