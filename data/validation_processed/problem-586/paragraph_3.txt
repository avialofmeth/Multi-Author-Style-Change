I think it becomes even more obvious when you look at right-wing media and hosts like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity at Fox News or even to Infowars Alex Jones. They formed 'characters' to best appeal and build-up the bases they were making money off of and try to 'maintain' the appearance of really being that even when if you begin to look at their 'real life' you would see just how different they are, see their kids going to elite 'leftist' private schools, etc...
