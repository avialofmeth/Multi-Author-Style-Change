And what's your evidence that the reason we're in the middle is because Biden did too much, as opposed to too little? In other words, why are you attributing our performance being only as good as it is to Biden, as opposed to Republicans who prevented him from doing more? If Republicans had abstained on all Biden's bills, and this is where we ended up, it would be fair to say Biden and Democrats fully owned our performance. But given that Republicans constantly exercised the filibuster and held Biden and Democrats back from enacting all their plans, why should we blame Biden and not Republicans instead?
