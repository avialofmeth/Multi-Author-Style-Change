Japan and Korea are not interested in being the stage for a battle that would lead to world war 3 and will probably do everything in their power to remain neutral with an obvious tilt towards America. But they are not gonna risk all that damage on command from America unless the first strike comes externally. It makes more since for them to play a balancing act. After all they are not owned by America.
