I definitely think that’s a large part of it, I also feel it’s a large dose of “well I won’t get shunned in that social circle for this because apparently we’re all into the same thing”. So this way he still gets to hang out with a rich , social class of people who don’t give a shit if it’s a smear campaign against him or if he really did it. Doesn’t matter at all to him that they are the scum of the earth, although I do like to think he gets sad that the truly great people of this society want nothing to do with him ( this part might just be me fantasizing lol ).
