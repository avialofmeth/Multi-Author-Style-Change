Geopolitics is always about juggling and lesser evils. But here the only winning move is not to play into Russia's schemes. Putin is an expert strategist. He allows Navalny to exist in order to lightning-rod criticism and control. You supporting Navalny actually supports Putin's machinations. After all, why is Nemtsov dead, but not Navalny? Why leave his demise up to far more "chance"?
