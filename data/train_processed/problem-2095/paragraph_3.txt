I’ve often wondered why interviewers so rarely ask GOP lawmakers to reconcile their apparently newfound concern over deficits with the party’s many decisions to massively increase deficits. Perhaps media interlocutors fail to ask not because they’re lazy or ill-prepared, but because they were able to differentiate the two distinct species of Republicans earlier than the rest of us were.
