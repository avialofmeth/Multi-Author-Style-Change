Reading it over, it's... An "interesting" law suit. Unclear if it will succeed. DoJ's request for a dismissal is legitimate, in that unraveling this onion gets into the issue of executive privilege vs executive authority, which could get messy super fast and that the basis of this suit exceeds its implied scope.
