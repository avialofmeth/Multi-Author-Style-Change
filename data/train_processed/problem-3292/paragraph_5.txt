Unless it's explodes and you have gangrene rolling around. I did and the agony. There were times I'd Black out and it was nice. I don't remember much because of that but I was in 7th grade and my "dad" let me suffer. Only reason he took me in is because the cops got called. Then after acted like it was my fault.
