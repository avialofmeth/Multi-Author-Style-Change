There was a “culture tradition “ regarding sexual assault and rape of young boys. A lot of this was done by certain Afghani allies such as police chiefs, military, warlord, rich older Afghani. Ironically Taliban banned this culture with punishment of death. They saw it as homosexuality and not to my knowledge as being a peadophile. There was good allies who respected the law/mission and bad allies.
