One other thing also confuses me, how would russia defend itself against either outside invading forces or inside civil war? Like countries like Kazakhstan, Georgie, North Korea or even China could start anexing parts of russia and Putin would be powerless against it. Or local parta of russia at the borders could break out and start their own countries. Putin put 100% of his forces to ukraine and he is relying on the fact that he is the only ashole on the planet actually disrupting official state borders. NATO cant invade russia due to nuclear weapons, but what would putin do if Georgie annexed a piece of russia? or if china annexed the east part of russia where they have been stealing lumber for decades? It is almost funny how russia knows they are the only bad guys on the planet and yet it doesnt stop them, it encourages them. If Mongols were still a thing, Mongolie would be the largest country by now.
