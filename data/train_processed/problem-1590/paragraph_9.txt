Tanks must be moved long distances on specially designed, usually modified rail cars. They really don't handle long periods of engine strain well (and that would raise the question of who exactly would drive them), which is the only way to avoid what would happen the minute they start sending those tanks in, which is the railroads get utterly destroyed to prevent it. Which is a bit of a problem when that's the only way to move freight and large numbers of people securely in and out of Ukraine at the moment.
