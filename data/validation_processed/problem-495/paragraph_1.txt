Looking at the Senate and the races that will be up for election Democrats will be lucky to hold the senate actually. In the house Republicans also have a large built in advantage. Biden also does not draw a lot of enthusiasm and unfortunately it looks like he will be the nominee. Republicans are far from dead unfortunately. But who knows a lot can change in 2 years.
