Like any other place on the planet, really. This is why it was so offensive when Trump referred to developing countries as "shitholes", it was a horrible insult, and completely hypocritical given the problems faced in the United States. Wholesale pilfering of public land by the oligarchs, for example, mining, timber, grazing, theft of resources, undrinkable water supplies in some places, crumbling bridges and roadways, the homeless sleeping in camps on the street corners of hallowed cities.
