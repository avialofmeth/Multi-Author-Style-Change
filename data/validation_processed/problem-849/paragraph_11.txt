The amount of hoops you have to go through in some states for it is exactly the amount of hoops that should be required to get your first firearm in the first place. Any additional firearm should be as easy to buy as it currently is, but not your first. If you don’t have the patience to turn in all the documentation and renew it periodically, then you shouldn’t be allowed to own a firearm at all. Of course, this is assuming SCOTUS and 3 letter agencies successfully force the states to actually process those applications in a timely manner and make the processes (including training) free, otherwise it’s just a 2A violation waiting to be struck down.
