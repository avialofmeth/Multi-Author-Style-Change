And that's all one of our two parties want to run on today. Feelings and spectacle. They want to feel anger, because if someone says the Not Us team are trafficking children in furniture boxes, well, they're not us and therefore evil, so it feels right, doesn't it? When a president gets on a podium and mocks a political opponent like a second grader, the shocked and angered reaction by Not Us is the same spectacle as watching one big dude barrel through two other big dudes, not drop a ball, and keep running.
