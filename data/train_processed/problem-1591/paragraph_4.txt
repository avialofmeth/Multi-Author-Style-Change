I think he’s saying if you put a war in a bag, shake it up, and pour it out, you’re going to get nothing but bastards, your’s or theirs. Heroes are only side-subjectively chosen. The dead can’t argue the point. You may be right morally or ethically, or even fighting for survival, but if you’re doing it right, then you’re being as much of a hateful bastard as you can be to your enemies.
