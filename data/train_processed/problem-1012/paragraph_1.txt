Because fascism is a dictatorial regime in which a person came to power illegally, obtained full powers and has a monopoly on the press and the media. There is therefore only one party and it is illegal to have political opposition and a thought that is opposed to those of the dictator. There is the exaltation of war, violence and race. Although it is a far-right government, if you call it a fascist government you should open some history books.
