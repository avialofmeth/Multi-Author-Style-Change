Remember: Bad faith is the entire purpose of public Russian discourse right now. That's the whole point. The statements made are specifically intended to be outrageous. It's a tactic that Russia, and those who've been coopted by Russia, have been using for a while now -- it's a diversionary tactic designed to steal your attention from what's actually happening and getting you to focus on the absurd positions they take and defend. It's a strategy designed to be infuriating and exhausting and fatiguing; like a river of shit that slowly wears down a stone.
