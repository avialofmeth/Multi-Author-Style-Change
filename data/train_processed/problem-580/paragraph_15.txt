Of course, if the data was not real, then theft couldn't be charged, but it'd be funny to see Hunter press charges against all these parties if they assert the claim the data is real. Hunter will get off because the FBI seems already intent on not finding anything they can prosecute. But if they won't prosecute, and these asshats want to press the issue, then all these other parties aren't protected from their crimes.
