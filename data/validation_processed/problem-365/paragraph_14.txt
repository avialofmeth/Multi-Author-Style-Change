I also think (I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory and might be one) that the majority of people in power in the west are in favor of creating a worldwide recession to crash the economies of primarily Russia but also China. As mainly consumers the west will face hardship but not a existential threat. As an energy producing country Russia will have their entire economy wrecked, and for China as they have not managed to grow any local domestic consumption compared to the west they will also meet much more serious economic hardship at a time when they already have economic issues.
