Hmm kind of hard to say. The Italians can grow hazelnuts all by themselves obviously. But even though Nutella is marketed as 'chocolate and hazelnut' spread, apparently it's mostly sugar and palm oil. Which has it's own problems. There's a lot more awareness about deforestation as a result palm oil in the mainstream, especially in the last 10 years.
