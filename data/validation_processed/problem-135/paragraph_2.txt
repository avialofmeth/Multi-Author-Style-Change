I can't imagine how utterly delusional you have to be to say America has the highest standard of living in history. While yes, you can't compare the Taliban and the GOP, America sits in the mid-twenties in every ranking of Quality of Life, even ones made by Americans. Among western countries, america is one of the worst places to live.
