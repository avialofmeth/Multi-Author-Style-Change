I spent 5 years in the 80s on a NATO base in Germany. We trained extremely hard because we thought we were facing a superpower military that could potentially destroy us in battle (overwhelming force, numbers, ect). Looking back now I realize that we had absolutely nothing to worry about. The Russians were and are a paper military.
