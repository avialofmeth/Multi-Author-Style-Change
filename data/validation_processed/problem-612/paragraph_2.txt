The thing about projection though is that the idea provides a tool for understanding people's psyche, and an important part is that it is an unconscious impulse. The way I understand it, it can either be expressed as a defense mechanism defending one's own deep-down known faults, projecting the same motivations on others — "yes I do this, sure, but look, everybody does" — or maybe it's just because they think that way and so just assume everybody does: when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail.
