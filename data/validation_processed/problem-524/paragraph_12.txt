Putin's 20+ years of brainwashing have definitely taken a toll, including outside of Russia, but as the memories of the 2000s economic boom recede (with declining real incomes for almost a decade now) and Russia's worldwide influence and situation become worse, Putin's leverage and prestige among the population has been falling. However, so far he's been careful to keep a relatively good life in Moscow and St. Petersburg (where a threat to his power would be most apparent) by sucking ever more resources from the countryside to those centers, to compensate for the lack of economic development as a whole in the country.
