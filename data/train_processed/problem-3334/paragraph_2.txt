There’s a good chance that it’s the parent’s fault, but believe it or not, it isn’t always necessarily the parent who can be blamed. My wife was a teacher and worked in one of the roughest schools in inner city Philadelphia. She once told me that younger kids would bring in guns to school to give to their older siblings, I think because the older kids were searched more thoroughly at the time. The older siblings would be involved in gangs or selling drugs, so someone would give the little kid a gun to take to their older sibling. In that case, there is sometimes little a parent can do. The pull of the streets is inexorable for too many Now, I’m not saying that is the case here; whoever is running the show at home could easily have neglected to track their own weapons. All I’m saying is that it isn’t always the parents’s fault, and it’s conceivable that the little kid who shot the teacher was holding the gun for someone else but lost his temper in the meantime.
