It isn't, Amsterdam loses money on tourism... The amount of money spent on police required to keep them in check and the amount of damages the tourists cause doesn't even get covered by what Amsterdam 'earns' on tourism. Also almost all employees of restaurants and whatnot in the city centre are people with work visas, most money doesn't even end up in Amsterdam. There's Dutch articles on this if you want a source, couldn't find an English one sorry.
