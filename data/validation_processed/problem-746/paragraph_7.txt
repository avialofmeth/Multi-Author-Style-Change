While I agree with all your other points, the Russian colonization of Crimea has been a very long process and most of the colonizers there were not just from the past decade. It has been going on for centuries at various times, and especially took off once Soviets took control and deported the Tatars to Siberia in 1944. Some Tatars even came back after the USSR collapsed, but not nearly as many were there originally.
