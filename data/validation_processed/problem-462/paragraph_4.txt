The only thing I can remember about him before Wogan is something with horses, maybe on kids' TV. Icke is in a cart, and the guy that knows about horses is asking him politely, then impatiently, to stop rolling about laughing like a maniac because balance, physics, etc. Then the cart tips over and they fall out.
