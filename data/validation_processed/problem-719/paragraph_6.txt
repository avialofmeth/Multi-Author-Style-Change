I actually just heard it today. Qualified immunity means no suing the cops unless there is established law which specifically means a nearly exact case to the situation at hand that violated the constitution had to have been ruled on. So for new cases like social media that havenâ€™t had a constitutional case heard and ruled on in court you can never sue a cop.
