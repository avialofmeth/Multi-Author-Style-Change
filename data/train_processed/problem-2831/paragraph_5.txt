While they're frantic and worked up, and still seem fairly loyal to the man, AND there are still a handful of people clinging to "It isn't Trump's fault, THEY CHEATED AGAIN!" ... there is not nearly as much of that as there was in 2020. I also think that T\_D's new home is pretty much the only place left where the message is majority pro-Trump.
