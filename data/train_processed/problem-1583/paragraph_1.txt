But beyond Reddit, imagine doing a search for, say, election candidate policies. All the major reputable and/or neutral news sites have decided to charge for link shares, so they disappear from Google/Bing/DDG/etc search results. The results that do show up are now, naturally, from sites that chose not to charge for link sharing, which would likely be from sites that do not require sustained traffic revenue to keep functioning (say, sites that get their funding from rich right wing oligarchs who are fine dumping pocket change into a site that actively spreads false information about policies they are against).
