bud, i am describing it from the point of view of their national myth. they seriously think that of themselves thanks to Patriotic EducatioTM and a generous understanding of the lands they were granted by other powers. in actual history they are the biggest losers in Europe, believing themselves a great power despite the mere reason that their Uralic language has survived is that they made allies quite quickly. under that view of history not only is their current condition not humiliating like they view it, it is the best position they have been in since Genghis Khan, being able to get jobs abroad, visit family that was left outside Hungary due to WWI and being able to enjoy political freedoms. and it would mean that corruption and election engineering would be problems both obvious and in need of addressing.
