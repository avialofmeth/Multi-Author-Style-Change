Even if we take that to be valid in reference to the UN convention, the argument falls flat on its face when you realize that Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin do not face the same treatment as non-citizens. Nor do Palestinian residents in Jerusalem, who actually have municipal voting rights, and are for all intents and purposes treated similarly to non-citizen residents in any other country. If Israel's goal was to "establish and maintain domination" of Jews over Palestinians, they wouldn't have a full 20% of their population be of Arab descent. Nor would they have Arabs and Palestinian supporters within their government. Yet both those are true.
