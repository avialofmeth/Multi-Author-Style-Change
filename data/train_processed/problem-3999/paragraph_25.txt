It's super easy to paint it like a hero mission like in the movies. In reality dying for your beliefs means your wife will be a widow, your kids will not have father, your house will be stigmatized, they will lose their jobs and being in contact with anyone close to you will be forbiden, meaning your family, friends and neighbourts will stop talking to them and the life of those around you is going to get really bad because of your action.
