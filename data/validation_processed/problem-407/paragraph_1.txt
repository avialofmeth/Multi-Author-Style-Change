When I was in high school I had the chance to go to DC to meet my state senators, and was super disappointed that both Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow couldn't make the time to see us even though the organization through which we went had advertised that as a key thing. Instead, they sent someone to speak to us who might have struck me as the most boring, lab-grown policy wonk to ever exist. I figured he'd just disappear into the aether of political history, and no one would ever know who he was.
