Also, this is going to be an unpopular thing to be heard but I'm going to say it. If someone's going to abuse/exploit woman, they are just going to do it regardless. If the UK government want to concern themselves with such an issue, maybe they should first address the underfunded police service that is no longer investigating such crimes due to lack of funding and man power.
