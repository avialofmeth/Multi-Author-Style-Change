No, I'm not SURE about that, but it's about what can be proven in court. I would think it difficult to prove religious discrimination when both parties are the same religion, and there's no additional language in the law to even recognize that the idea of 'caste' exists. It seems like an easy way to clarify and update the law to include something that wasn't really an issue in 1964 but is certainly in keeping with its spirit.
