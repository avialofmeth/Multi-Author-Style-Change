The local racism does get very tiring though. I lived with a black roommate for 7 years. She's one of my closest friends. My ex was black-Japanese. And my mother would embarrass me every time with the "I don't want monkey grandchildren" line anytime I brought anyone even vaguely brown home... to the point I stopped bringing people to meet her.
