not to mention that many "neutral" countries are already helping European nations skirt sanctions by simply re-exporting russian oil, india being the most public example of this. all they have to do is slap a "made in india" sticker on imported russian oil and presto! its no longer russian oil. its indian oil now, free to export to any country in the world, neatly sidestepping all sanctions.
