I'd say, about 3 years - and it likely will include at least one major conflict with the Palestinians. There do not seem to be any factors breaking the coalition apart in the near term, however the mere fact that Ben Gvir with his very hardline stance on the Palestinians has control over the Border Police (The Israeli police force in the West bank) as Head of the National Security Ministry creates a very significant chance of conflict (Palestinians will not simply accept any new crackdown against them). Such a conflict could very well break the coalition sometime in the next few years, depending on who is blamed on it and how intense it becomes.
