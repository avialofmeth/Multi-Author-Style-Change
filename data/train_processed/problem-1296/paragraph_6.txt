It's what makes me sad for Russia. I knew a lot of Russian immigrants in the last industry I worked in, and they were always great people. Friendly and fun-loving (and a lot of nihilism as you point out). I really wish perestroika had worked out better for them. Oh well. Their government still sucks ass-covered dildo, though.
