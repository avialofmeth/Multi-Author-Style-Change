It’s insane. I watched the 2 part Frontline doc on this and it’s so insane how Pegasus is an unregulated company. Their shit ass of a lawyer told reporters that they vet countries who buy the software yet when pressed about Hungary and why they were given the software when its KNOWN that Hungary is a sketchy place at best, he had no answer and kept repeating “we don’t talk about our current customers”.
