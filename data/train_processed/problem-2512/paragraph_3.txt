Only way this will stop is regime change in Russia, and only way that happens is when population is so desperate and pissed that they fear for their future more than they fear their government. Se lets stop being naive, this deifnetly will get much worse before it gets better, and I would like it to get worse for the Russians rather than for the Ukrainians.
