I'm not claiming that majority of Russians are oppressed innocents, probably far from it and currently much less than the sum of "apolitical" majority and active putin supporters. But the opposition forces are higher than we notice on the first glance. Somebody is brave enough lighting buildings on fire, many are in prison or in forced immigration, some are moving out of the country themselves with their capital and tax money, few even participate in public activism still, but even more are just anonymously voicing their opinion online... Still not enough, but shouldn't be ignored imo.
