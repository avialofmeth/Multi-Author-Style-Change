To be honest with you, Iâ€™m still quite impressed by the tenacity of mainstream media to ask, again and again, the same question when they think that the response does not reflect reality or the truth.To my deep disappointment, an enduring feeling of deference often constrains the French media, which can be again explained by the central place of the state in our society and also by the roots of French journalism which were very similar to what happened in the United States during the Gilded Age.
