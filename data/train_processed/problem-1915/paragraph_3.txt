Zelenskyy on the Day of Dignity and Freedom: "No one has succeeded and will never succeed to take our freedom away. I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed?  A lot. Craters on our land. Roadblocks, anti-tank hedgehogs. Cold in our homes. But these have not changed the most important thing. Ukrainians are not used to surrendering. They have dignity. And therefore - freedom We will overcome everything. Endure. Survive. Prevail".
