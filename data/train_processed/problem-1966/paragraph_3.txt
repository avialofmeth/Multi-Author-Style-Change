Russia is an authoritarian state that spent past 22 years perfecting it's oppression tools. Opposition is always playing a high risk, low reward game - so many are just saving themselves until the government is in a tight spot and there is an opening to do something meaningful. You can notice that behavior all the way from 2012 with protests hitting the streets each time government crossed a line, then going back underground after being unsuccessful.
