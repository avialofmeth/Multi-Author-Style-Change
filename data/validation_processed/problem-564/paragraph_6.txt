Ukraine also has a well trained (by west) and heavily present partisan movement behind enemy lines. They pass coordinates to strategic buildings (soldier hotels, ammo depots, heavily guarded places) to long range artillery which takes them out swiftly. Nobody wants to be in those places now, especially high ranking people and politicians.
