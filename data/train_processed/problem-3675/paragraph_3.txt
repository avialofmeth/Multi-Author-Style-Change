This is a poor response and frankly nothing less than i would expect from someone who could still argue a case for the EU, we were never asked if we wanted to join, and had made it pretty clear before the EEC vote that we wouldn’t want to join an EU, but they forced it through anyway despite the overwhelming opposition to joining an EU system, and you’re surprised we voted out when finally given a democratic choice? Its what happens when the government decides to subvert the will of the people.
