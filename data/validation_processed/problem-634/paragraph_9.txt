All of this leads to a problem that used to plague the Democrats... the core GOP message has fallen out of orbit with the rest of the country and is drifting into outer space. Again, they are still plenty dangerous. But the old "go right in the primary, tack to the center in the general" model has been incinerated. A generation raised on almost 30 years of propaganda demand candidates as crazy and furious as they are. And the center (myself included, former GOP) think it's fucking bonkers.
