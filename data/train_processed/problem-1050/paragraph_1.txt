The taxes are used to fulfill the constitutional requirement to educate children. Giving away money to random third parties doesn't help solve that problem because those schools by necessity will cost more and have a profit motive rather than being directly dedicated to education. Besides that, since they're not required to take all children, they will necessarily require there to be two school systems funded by taxes, the private one and the public one which takes all the kids the private schools don't want to take. Does paying twice for the same education make sense financially to you? Nope.
