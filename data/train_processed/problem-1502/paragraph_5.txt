It's also worth noting that it's hard to change these kind of laws quickly (needs a public vote on it). Especially if like here in Switzerland, you have parties that are either fulky brownnosing Russia or at best indifferent to it because there is money to be made. The executive, i.e. the bundesrat, could override this law, but it is held 4/7 by those parties.
