Edits: The article claims that the FBI supports the theory that Covid originated from a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Viriology according to a linked article - it doesn't. The linked article is about a FORMER head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service/MI6 claiming such. Hell, despite claiming that this was leaked to the Wall Street Journal, it didn't even bother sourcing or linking the WSJ.
