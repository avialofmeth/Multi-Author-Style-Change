It is possible Aldrich is nonbinary, and hiding it behind anger and self-loathing and irony. It is possible Aldrich is nonbinary, but it means nothing to them, they're just an unrepentant sociopath. And it's also possible Aldrich is a man calling himself nonbinary because it'd be funny. Personally, I'm using they/them for Aldrich, just in case they are in a lot of pain, but I don't fault others who are too angry at Aldrich to care. The wide range of trust/distrust towards a mass murderer doesn't disprove the validity of gender expression, any more than it proves we shouldn't trust people in general.
