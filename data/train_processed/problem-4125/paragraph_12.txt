We in iran are going through terrific time experiencing extreme violence in every possible way (straight shooting, execution, sexual harassment and rape, forced confession, imprisonment and...) and we need to spread our voice to the world and I'm pretty sure that something like this talk can help us enormously to inform people about the situation here. We would appreciate any opportunity like this.
