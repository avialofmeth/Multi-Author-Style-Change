Well hang on, back in the 1900s Britain had the world's biggest economy, we stopped the slave trade and lost economic value. We dismantled our empire and lost economic value, but the people wanted these things to occur to progress our society and way of life. Brexit is the same, yes we'll lose some value from the EU for a bit but we'll be fine in the end.
