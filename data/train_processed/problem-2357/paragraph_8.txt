As an example, let's say google is a supporter of the russian invasion of Ukraine. The folks they deem russians supporters may enjoy less ads, faster connections, and an overall more enjoyable experience. The Ukrainian supporters however, may start seeing ads and news articles that paint Ukraine as the aggressor and russia as the good guys. Over time you'll see more and more supporters of russia because these companies are able to target users and show them what the company wants its users to see and think.
