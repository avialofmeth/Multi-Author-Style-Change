This irks me in so many ways and the failure to hold Trump accountable for his much different situation is what is going to cause a ton of chaos around Biden’s. The Biden situation absolutely needs to be probed but in both cases we need way more transparency and public education on what/if was criminal in either case. Trump has obviously engaged in criminal conduct in how he obstructed the probe trying to get them back and also lying about it. He has to be held accountable yesterday, but the failure by feckless Garland is allowing the right to “both side” the shit out of this. Further eroding the public trust in the DOJ.
