IANAL but I would think the first amendment allows you to criticize and satirize the police, even if it makes their jobs more difficult. But if the criteria is that a similar case has to have been heard before, and the supreme court declines to hear any similar cases, then it sounds like we no longer have the right to satirize the cops without fear of arrest.
