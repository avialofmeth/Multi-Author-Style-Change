A foundational belief of Falun Gong is that the CPC is illegitimate, so it's not a surprise they got suppressed. I'm not shedding any tears, it was an insanely racist cult. Li Hongzhi is not an idiot, he knows he can't actually levitate, he's just making this stuff up to build a following in order to influence Chinese politics.
