Well, the US federal government did manage to keep the wheels from completely falling off while a functionally illiterate, highly-compromised conman was president for four years. Weâ€™re finding more and more issues (like the speaker silliness) where the rules were created with the idea that people would act in good faith, and would actually want a functioning democracy. Hopefully the US can keep its head above water while the grown ups adjust some things to account for the moral plague of the modern GOP. In the interim, probably unfair to compare things to a country with less than half the population of California.
