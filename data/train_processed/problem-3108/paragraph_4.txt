Indore is probably the cleanest city in India and that's because the mentality of the people there involves them in trying to keep their city clean as much as possible. If you throw garbage around, people would beat you up instead, from a personal expereince that I faced. India, more or less needs to follow the same ideal and only then the country would start to be clean.
