I don't interpret these jokes as "laughing at the guy about to be hung." The joke is not, "Haha, look at this asshole who stepped out of line and is about to die," although I'm sure there are people who take it that way. It's more like, "Haha, look at this megalomaniacal sociopath who is so obsessed with expanding and retaining power, he slips polonium into his critics' meals." Oh, and, "Haha, this sociopath is the absolute ruler of one of the world's largest countries and nuclear superpowers, and could probably initiate the apocalypse if he chose to do so." That is, part of the point of these jokes is to ridicule assholes with their boots on everyone else's throat--they're punching up, not down (at the lawmaker). The other part is just sort of chuckling at the sad state of the world.
