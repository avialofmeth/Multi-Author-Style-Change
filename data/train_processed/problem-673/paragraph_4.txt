There are a few out there like Ben and Jerrys, but when a corporation does something like run an ad with a mixed race couple or do a gay pride month promotion, I promise you they have done a calculation that this will play well with the majority of their audience. When Ford and GM make a proclamation about going all or majority EV, it's because they see where the market is heading. When massive investment firms and banks talk about the environment, it's because they are reacting either to real financial impacts they are measuring or see customers care about these things.
