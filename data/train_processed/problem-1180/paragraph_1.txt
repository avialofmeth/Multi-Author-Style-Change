Can someone explain why Russia would want to sabotage Nord Stream? As far as I can see, as long as Nord Stream is in place then Russia has another card that it can use against the West: if you're nice to us then we may give you some gas; if not then we withdraw it. By destroying Nord Stream, Russia no longer has any leverage. What does Russia have to gain?
