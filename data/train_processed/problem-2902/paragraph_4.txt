It is true that Israel has a national interest to find physical archeologic references to Jewish history seeing itself as a Jewish state. but in doing so they are helping us all imo as archeology is shared with the world, peer reviewed and helps us piece the puzzle of our human history. Including our own bias and stories we were told. I resent that some of this info is used towards nationalism. I would much rather it be historic and academic. But this indeed looks like a pre Hanukkah nationalistic propoganda piece.
