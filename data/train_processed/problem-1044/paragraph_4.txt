A S-300 was found at the scene (), but it's a missile that both Ukraine and Russia use. It's also a missile that the vast majority have been made in Russia/Soviet Union (hence the Polish Foreign Ministry's "Russian-made"). Russia's been repurposing them as ground attack missiles (seen in Kharkiv - ) and Ukraine has been shooting Russian strikes down with S-300s as well.
