I heard some"expat" living in Qatar being interviewed yesterday downplaying the migrant labor thing, talking about how happy the security guards seem. Then she talked about how hot it gets in summer and how just walking 20m from the doorway to her parked car is an exhausting ordeal, without any mental click between her ordeal in having to walk across a parking lot and the experience of people working construction jobs in that heat. Just complete self absorbed "expat" shit, like "there's a real community, people from all over the world", like yeah, no shit, you're in an expat bubble hanging out with expats.
