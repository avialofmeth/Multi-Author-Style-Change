Dianne Feinstein's staff and national Democrats have been covering for her cognitive decline for years. Right wingers had nothing to do with that deception. Yes, conservatives want to destroy faith in our institutions. But when mainstream Dems aren't saying anything while someone who is clearly mentally unfit to serve is continuing the last year and a half of her term, they are doing a terrible job at preserving what little trust still remains in our institutions. It's unfair to expect anyone to trust them about a liberal politician's physical and/or mental fitness.
