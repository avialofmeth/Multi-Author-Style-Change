Bottom line: the DOJ isn’t just getting involved here because it’s crypto, they’re getting involved because it appears FTX’s leadership knowingly committed serious financial crimes. The upside here is that this will hopefully be the kick in the nuts all the crypto bros need to recognize that if they want crypto to stick around, some level of regulation is needed to prevent exactly this kind of financial crime.
