What a crock of shit. It absolutely was about tricking people. And Iâ€™m glad Piers Morgan said that to his face. The whole giggling Santos did after that is one of the things that liars do when they get busted. Santos is telling one truth, he is a terrible liar. And when he says he is a terrible liar, he means because he got caught. He lied terribly as opposed to smoothly.
