Which ever party spends the most in Florida wins every time. Dems abandoned Florida after 2012, the last time dens outspent and won. It’s also maybe the most transient state so it’s never worth abandoning. To much flux. This last election was a catastrophe. Never saw a single Christ sign, ad, sticker, poster, event or anything. It’s pay to play and dems didn’t pay.
