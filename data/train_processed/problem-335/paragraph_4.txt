Government is giving massive amount of subsidies to people for EVs. Also, massive agriculture aids and interest free loans to farm palm and oil seed crops. Would have achieved this a year ago if economists like rihanna, mia Khalifa and others would not have misguided farmers against farm laws that benefited them. Punjabis are gonna regret missing out on prosperity for a long time.
