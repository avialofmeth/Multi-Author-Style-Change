The law of unintended consequences has allowed Russia to snap up a huge fleet of ageing oil tankers that would otherwise have been scrapped, to ship crude to India, China and the rest of Asia. While the shipping cost have increased the companies are making nearly $0.5M per day each, from these shipments. While oil for the West will soon increase dramatically, oil for the West's trade competitors are falling equally dramatically. Good for China, not so good for the West.
