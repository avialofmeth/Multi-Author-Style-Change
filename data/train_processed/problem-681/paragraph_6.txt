Let's look at another example. On one hand, if I'm well aware that a person is sensitive to strobe lights and it's reasonably foreseeable that they will go into a seizure if exposed to them, and I intentionally shine a strobe light in their eyes, I have certainly committed a crime. On the other hand, if I slip a drug into their drink that is known for causing seizures in many people, I have also committed a crime.
