Women can't bear to think that their husbands, fathers, and brothers would be so evil. So they convince themselves that republicans/christians hold the morally just positions. The father that makes gross comments about women is acceptable if you believe it's women's fault for the way they're treated. Abortion bans are easier to cope with if you believe your god-ordained role is to give birth.
