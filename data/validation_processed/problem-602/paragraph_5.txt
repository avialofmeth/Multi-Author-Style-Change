You did said that higher pressure would indicate that it's frozen, which is not true. Anyway, the fact is, we don't know yet. My assumption is just that, an assumption. Like, if I had to bet 10 bucks, I'd bet them on liquid below zero C, that's it. (also, that wouldn't be a river if it was solid ice anyway).
