if it was just one protest? sure - but with a slowdown in economic growth the state might decide to cut more social spending which is a big part of why the populace has not risen up before. People accept a curtailing of civil liberties more easily if they benefit from society as a whole. If people do not have enough money then they get pissed at the government and if the government as it is used to responds with violence the people get angrier.
