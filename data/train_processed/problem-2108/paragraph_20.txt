I grew up in Manitowoc, WI, which was about 50% Roman Catholic. When the Strand Cinema showed a movie which was on the banned list of the Roman Church, the Roman Church ordered members not to go to the Strand Cinema for three years as punishment for the Cinema. At a high school graduation ceremony in Manitowoc a protestant clergyman was scheduled to deliver an invocation. Because of that the Roman Church directed its members not to attend.
