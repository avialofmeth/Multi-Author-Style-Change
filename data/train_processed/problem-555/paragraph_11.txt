If we remove Biden, we have to deal with some fresh faces who might have skeletons in their closet. Newsom, Klobuchar all have some shit. On the progressive side, anyone from the Squad will skyrocket Republican turnout, so they're not an option. And apart from Bernie, there isn't anyone who can lead the progressive movement (Fetterman is too new and tbh he isnt progressive in the way Bernie is, he triangulates, he was pro fracking etc).
