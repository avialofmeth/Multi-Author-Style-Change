I mean what are the odds that a group of strangers with no political affiliations with each other all randomly decided to show up on Washinon DC that day and then all spontaneously did what they did with no organization or motive or leadership. Honestly one of the strangest things I've ever seen, sociologists will be studying it for years to try and figure out what caused it all. Maybe when Trump gets re-elected he can form a committee to look into why all that Jan 6th stuff happened? I think the American people deserve answers.
