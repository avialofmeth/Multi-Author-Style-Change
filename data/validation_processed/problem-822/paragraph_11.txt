If the vast majority of people were opposed to diversity, then companies would get far more financial pressure to avoid it. I don't know what to tell you, this is free market capitalism in action. There's a reason all these conservative alternatives to these companies and services are not anywhere near as successful (if they're successful at all). It's because that is what most people are opposed to.
