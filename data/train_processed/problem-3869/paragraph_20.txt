In western Canada, it was kinda scary, because a lot of money from the US flowed into their organizations very quickly, to get them organized with communications, merchandise, websites, fundraising. It wasn't just a few random people with weird ideas that pass a hat anymore. It was a very controlled and coordinated effort, which is why it got as big as it did. They had a way bigger voice than the number of supporters they actually had.
