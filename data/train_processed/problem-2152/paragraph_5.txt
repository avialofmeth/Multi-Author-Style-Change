I agree. And this time, we will learn from the mistakes of Iraq and Afghanistan. Focus on eradication of military targets (which can be done primarily by air and sea, boots on the ground should be kept to an absolute minimum), and leave civilian infrastructure completely unharmed (as much as possible). Perhaps a targeted decapitation strike to the Islamic Regime leadership. Afterward, pull out.
