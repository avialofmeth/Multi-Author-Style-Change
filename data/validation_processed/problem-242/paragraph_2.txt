Yep. Feel like the only way someone would think Dutch people actually like Heineken is if they'd only ever been to the red light district in Amsterdam. You guys have some fucking magnificent beer. Last time I was there I remember wandering through the Jordaan for hours and finding some epic little bars that had beer I'd never heard of that was amazing.
