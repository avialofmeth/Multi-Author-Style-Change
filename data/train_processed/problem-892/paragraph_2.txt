I watched him play with the Cosmos when I was a kid. We went to Giants Stadium a few times per year for several years to watch him and Beckenbauer and Chinaglia play. Pele was older, but still a very VERY good player and it was a privilege to watch him play, even though I didn't know it at the time.
