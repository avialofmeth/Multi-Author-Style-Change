I didn't watch Tiger King when I found out it wasn't technically about tigers. I knew about Big Cat Rescue prior to this show, I had somehow stumbled on their YouTube channel years ago. I was annoyed that the show dragged their name through the mud, because it's a legit charity that actually takes care of its animals. The creator of the show didn't bother learning the very basic conservation fact that you can't release big wild cats back in the wild...there have been attempts and none were successful. So he just conflates the charity with the completely non-qualified people who own tigers for fun...pissed me off.
