Police officers went to the rural property to conduct a welfare check as it was believed that a missing person was there. As they were walking up the driveway they got shot at and three officers were injured, one managed to escape but the other two got shot again while they were on the ground. A neighbour who tried to help the officers (remote area with no backup for a while) also got shot and killed. The offenders then stole the police officer's weapons and radios and seemingly barricaded themselves in the house. Police helicopters and tactical police got called in, shooters started firing at both and police fired back, all 3 offenders didn't survive the ensuing gunfight.
