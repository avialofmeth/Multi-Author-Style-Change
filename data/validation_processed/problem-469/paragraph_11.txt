They put together that stupid new committee that they themselves drew together, announced that the minority party would only have 9 seats, and at least a majority need to vote on committee issues. By their own definitions, the minority party is just a spectator because the GOP can do whatever they want with their 12 member portion of the committee, and the dems will by design never have enough votes to stop them or impact any decisions. Does that sound like the practice of a party interested in genuine compromise, or like they want to lock out the other side from decisions?
