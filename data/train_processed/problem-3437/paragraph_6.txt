The biggest issue I have with criticism of Navalny is this: corruption is baked into everyday life in Russia. You can't open a store without having to pay "dues", the lack of social safety means people get by one way or the other. The idea that anyone could rise to prominence in a culture like that without ever doing anything shady is based either in ignorance or cynicism.
