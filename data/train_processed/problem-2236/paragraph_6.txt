Russia had a few Su-24MP, and Pods that could , theoretically, be added to other aircraft. But the big push was land based EW not aircraft based. Combine that with the training and sorte rate for RU in this war and it's looks pretty bad. Part of this is the Russian military is structured to repel invaders, but that is a longer post then this.
