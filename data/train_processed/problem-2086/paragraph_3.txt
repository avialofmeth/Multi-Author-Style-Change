And then we have what seems to be the woman in the article who apparently voted for the people who put her in this situation. She gonna vote for the same sort when she makes it to Colorado or wherever? Will she have "learned her lesson?" Sadly, I think she would vote for the same kind of assholes all over again, always assuming that she won't be the one negatively impacted.
