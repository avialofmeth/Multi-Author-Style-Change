No you don’t, you need a good candidate that will put in the work to win voters with differing opinions. Katie Porter is hardly what most would call moderate, but won her swing district. Warnock and Ossoff are fairly progressive, as is Fetterman and they won their purple states. Just because a moderate can win a race doesn’t mean only a moderate can win.
