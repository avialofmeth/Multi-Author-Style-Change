I should have phrased that differently. It would be a lot better if we had democratic politicians who actually set out as part of their platform to preserve gun rights. I am well aware that many folks on the left appreciate their gun rights just as much as those on the right, me being one of them, but that isn't reflected in the politicians who claim to represent us.
