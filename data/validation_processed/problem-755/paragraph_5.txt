So what I was taught in bioethics - at least for the US - is that the physician can overrule parental decisions like this in the situation where the child’s life is at risk. So for example - if a child is under the age of 12, and they’re a Jehovah’s Witness, and parents refuse blood transfusion on grounds of religion, physician can overrule that decision (going through correct channels of course).
