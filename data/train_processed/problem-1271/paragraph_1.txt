I remember reading years ago that some private prison/jail corporations have contracts with various states that say the state has to maintain a 90 to 95 percent occupancy rate. If that isn't contractually maintained, the state has to pay huge outrageous sums to the private entity or some shit like that. It was an article I read like back in 2005.
