In age of empires there are a few quick chats you can send since it's a fast paced rts when playing multiplayer you can type just a number into chat and it will play a sound, 1 says yes, 2 says no, 11 will play a cackling laugh. The community uses these in things like twitch chat as well so if something funny happens or is said the chat will spam 11s.
