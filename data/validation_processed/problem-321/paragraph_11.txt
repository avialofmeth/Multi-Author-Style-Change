If you took a sampling of popular movies, tv and rap/heavy rock music and shook it up you could dissect a murder a minute from what huge portions of our population pump into their brains when in reality almost none of us will ever experience an irl murder. That shit has been normalized by more than just the people doing it. It was normalized before that. And again, it doesn't just have to be acceptable to the common man to have an impact on society. It only needs to radicalize a few people out of hundreds of millions to have the impact we are feeling now.
