They want there to be “riots” (peaceful protests they can disrupt and attack) - they don’t want actual riots. If there were actual riots across the country the average white conservative would be terrified. That riot would likely never reach their small, rural communities, but attack the politicians at their homes with threats of violence and see how fast things change. With true riots if Rittenhouse were to show up with his gun he’d be shot rather than able to shoot unarmed protestors.
