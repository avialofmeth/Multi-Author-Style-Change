Pretty much. "Patriotic Education" is just a code word for far-right indoctrination. You can already see this happening in red states. Books about LGBT issues are being pulled out of libraries, lessons about civil rights, diversity, and inclusion are being pulled from the curriculum, and school staff are being forced out so that their positions will be filled by far-right ideologues. They're trying to hold onto power forever by molding Generation Alpha into the most conservative, religious, and bigoted generation yet, and they are currently winning.
