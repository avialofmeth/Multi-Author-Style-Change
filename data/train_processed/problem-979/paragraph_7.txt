Which one do I know better than? The Welsh chef claiming the McDs in Wales is the best McD's (out of the 40k in over 100 countries, which he assuredly has only sampled a handful) because his friend created a couple of recipes for that specific location? Or the other Michelin rated chef in the article who says (I paraphrase) it's a betrayal to the profession to partner with McDs and put chef-grade touches to a garbage product that is best for offering plastic toys to children to get them to drag their parents to buy subpar food?
