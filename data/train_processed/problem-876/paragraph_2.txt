Hypocrisy of it is that this rape was being done by our allies. However Western military never punished the rapists. Crackdown too hard, you lose your allies plus all the other corruption that went on over there. There was some news reports about it over in the West but never fully told. Otherwise support for the mission would vanish quickly if widespread knowledge was known.
