I'll say it again - France begins with the ancien r√©gime because before the Capetians and their severing of ties with and defence of their crown against the Carolingians ruling the remaining Frankish Empire, there was no extant "French" polity, only a non-distinct overlordship of the Western Frankish lands. A distinctly French political tradition only takes shape under the Capetians, and it would take hundreds of years before even the Capetians marked themselves as Kings of France, not Kings of Franks.
