Republicans have made it a point to see nothing wrong with what happened on Jan 6th. Despite what was just days after. Republican Revisionist history would have you believe Jan 6th was a peaceful protest that some zealots took “a little too far” in their zeal. Trump continues to deny that he had anything to do with those events. Yet in response to the 10 deaths in Monterey Park said "Yet our January 6th protestors, over a Rigged Election, have had their lives ruined despite nobody killed except true Patriot Ashli B. This situation will be fully rectified after 2024 Election.".
