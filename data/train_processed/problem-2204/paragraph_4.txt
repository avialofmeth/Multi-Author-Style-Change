The problem is that wages don't matter to the 1%. Their wealth is in stocks. Take someone like the CEO of Ford. His compensation package was 22m for 2021, but only 1.7m of that was salary. 16 million was in stock. So these people build these massive stock portfolios that they can borrow money against to live until they die. They could put their 1.7m salaries (7% of total compensation) off in a desk drawer and it wouldn't matter a bit to their lifestyle while everyone else struggles to make rent or get their kids an education. Republicans talk a bunch of shit about wealth redistribution and turn a blind eye to wealth extraction and labor exploitation.
