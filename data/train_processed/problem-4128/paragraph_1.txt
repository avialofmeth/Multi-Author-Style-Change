If the greatest effect of some situation is what the advocates do, then the situation is not a compelling situation and does not deserve immediate public thought. We know with climate change, the effects are slow and essentially invisible. You physically cannot make someone suddenly feel like there is a crisis when life literally does not change for them other than you pestering them. Petition the politicians when your solution is legislation. When that gets ignored, campaign for better politicians in a way that actually helps you get votes instead of pissing people off.
