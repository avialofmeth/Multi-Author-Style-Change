If you do want to understand a bit more context: Putin recently responded to russian moms on the death of their sons by simply asking them to have more children. That should be enough for you to gauge the level of support. There is also a lot of "whataboutism" unjustly comparing russia and the US in a way that tries to justify what russia is doing. So people, including myself might react hastily when something like that is posted.
