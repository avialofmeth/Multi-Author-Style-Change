Canada checking in here. Outside of Trudeau's recent scolding of Xi last week, I've not encountered anything in the media yet. If there is an investigation going on, it could take a little while, and the RCMP or CSIS won't comment during an active investigation. Even once it's done, there's no guarantee that any reports will become public. I hope they do though: it is most definitely something we ought to know for the public good.
