Similarly, while Soviet vehicles can easily fight ones of their own design, the war in Ukraine emphasized some critical design flaws, including some that Ukraine almost certainly wants to get away from. Most notably being the ammo stowage for the autoloader on the T-72/T-90 and T-64/T-80 designs. Where NATO nations store ammo in a separate compartment with failsafes such as a blast door and blowout panels to protect the crew in the fighting compartment should the primary stowage is hit and the the ammunition detonates, the Soviet designs instead placed the ammuntion in a carousel encasing the turret basket, meaning the tank's commander and gunner are surrounded by the ammunition. As a result, the crew are screwed in the event the ammunition detonates, and the vehicle will be a total loss, as you can see from wrecks in Ukraine, ones where the turrets are sent flying from the force caused by ammunition detonation.
