Much of what we’ve tried to do since WW2 is create international norms and diplomatic / economic mechanisms that can be used instead of traditional all-out warfare between large nations. In many ways it has worked, but it often looks like it’s not working because we tend to expect things to operate transparently and be taken at face value. Consider how many UN resolutions seem to go nowhere. But all that effort isn’t just being lost in the ether.
