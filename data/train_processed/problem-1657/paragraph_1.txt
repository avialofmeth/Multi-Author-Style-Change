Notice how despite everyone now saying "Trump can't win", no one really wants to say WHY he can't win. Because if they do that they'll realize that their reasons (his divisive, hateful, violent nature) actually applies to their entire party, from the base to their media to congressional leadership to Trump and everyone else who has a shot of winning the nomination in 2024. Even if they somehow manage to nominate someone else, it'll still be Trump-lite at best (it could easily end up being someone worse than Trump too).
