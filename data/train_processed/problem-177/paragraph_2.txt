I dont like Russia either but I wouldn't go that far (the Nazis were awful people too, do you want the Germans to stop existing too?). All of the Russians I've met so far were wonderful people. The main problem is the government and the propaganda. Russians are basically trained by their government to hate and belittle everyone who isn't Russia (Religion can have the same effect). And to add to the drama, many Russians can't leave the country for vacation because they don't have enough money thus they don't see how much better life outside of Russia is.
