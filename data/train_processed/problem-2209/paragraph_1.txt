At this point are the technology and so good that it’s not like anybody is getting across without CBP knowing, that’s not even the issue. The issue is that people are being exploited by the smugglers who tell them that they can get them asylum in the US on exchange for their life savings. So what happens is they send these groups out into the middle of the desert, have them walk just far enough that they are standing on US soil, and then they sit and wait for CBP agents to come arrest them. And since they are standing on US soil, in order to comply with the 4th Geneva convention we cannot send them back until we have determined whether or not they make meet all of the criteria for refugee status. That is a long and complex judicial process in federal courts so that gets them a year or two in the U.S. Often if they have family in the US who can take responsibility for them or some sort of group will take them in, they are released on their own recognizance because it’s too expensive.
