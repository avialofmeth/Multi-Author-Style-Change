I call it a sad irony because we know exactly what will happen: Republicans will blame the Biden Admin for open borders and weak security and whatnot incentivizing migrants, so Dems will be on the defensive and denying that thereâ€™s anything over which to be concerned. What will not happen is any sort of meaningful conversation much less policy regarding the actual drivers of migration at these levels.
