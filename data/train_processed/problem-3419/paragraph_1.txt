I used to live in Spain, and as an Estranjero I joined the Spanish Socialist Party PSOE more than 10 years ago. I decided to leave the party today. I can’t be a member of a party who treats animals like dirt just because of being afraid of losing votes in rural areas because of the Spanish Hunting association. It’s over PSOE.
