When it comes to Russia, all you have is lesser of evil outcomes. The one thing I would like to add is, even is Navalny would do evil shit eventually, the fifth column Russian who had to flee Putin's draft shouldn't be ignored. Even if you picture Navalny going full evil, it wouldn't happen immediately. Not to mention that after Putin's shenanigans, it's safe to assume that we are already back to Cold War style subversion campaigns, he wouldn't have that easy of a time, not to mention that all repressed people want access to their amenities they've lost because Putin couldn't keep it in his pants.
