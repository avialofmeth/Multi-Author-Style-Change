Head injuries increase among children wearing helmets for an unknown reason. It decreased overall for cyclists. As the writer points out, if helmets were effective, there should be a sharp decrease. But there are clearly a lot of other factors at play here that are not mentioned (and I don't read Swedish to see if they are in the original article), including if there was an overall increase in the total number of injuries across all ages or not, and why did the increase start before the helmet law came into effect? There was already a trend of increase especially in school aged children years before the law came into effect.
