This is silly. The Democrats are the minority without a compromise like this. The question for them is this: is it better to be in the minority with a reasonable partner whom you can govern with or be in the minority and held to the whims of Marjorie Taylor Greene and her ilk? Because if this continues and the Republicans have no other off-ramp, they will eventually cave to the far right and concede to someone like Jim Jordan as Speaker.
