Everyone thinks they can feed extremism and then control the extremists. Some may be thinking only of short-term expediency, but I think many underestimate the irrationality of True Believers. Or they misread the true believers, and think their piety is cynically performative, and really they can be bought off. Doesn't seem to work.
