Very true, long term convicts are sue crazy, any prison putting a inmate in known danger will incur a lawsuit from them or their families. Most of these awful humans are thrown together in isolated, single person cell pods, they will have a different rotation of yard time ect. As sad as it is the idea that there is some kind of “honor amongst thieves” and that these dudes will get what they deserve thanks to the faceless other of prisoners is a myth we tell ourselves to not see the reality.
