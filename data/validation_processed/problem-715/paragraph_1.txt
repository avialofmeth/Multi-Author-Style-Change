I work with adults who have had (sometimes multiple) traumatic brain injuries from car crashes or being hit by a car as a pedestrian. My specific job is teaching wood shop and art-related vocational skills, while my wife teaches warehouse work in a different building. The job is equally stressful and emotionally exhausting. Having to deal with a 200 pound adult with the temperament of a toddler can even be dangerous. The job pays less than the starting pay at McDonald's and the company treats the staff like prisoners along with the clients.
