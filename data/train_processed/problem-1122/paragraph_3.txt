Yeah Twitter or Reddit aren't exactly technically innovative in any way. But they are powerful as long as a large enough chunk of the population use them generating content others want to see. That majority also seems fine with some level of moderation to eliminate the worst actors that might make it too toxic. No one is flocking to the zero moderation alternatives that cropped up after Trump or others got shut down. But users are also fickle when it comes to social media when complaints get loud enough and your platform is seen as uncool. Changing momentum is hard and I wouldn't bet a dollar on the a specific start up vying for the crown, but eventually it can turn in a hurry and Twitter can become Digg.
