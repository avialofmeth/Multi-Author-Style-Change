I mean she handled that case like a pro. But it was also a black and white case. Darrell Brooks is a monster and thatâ€™s something both liberals and conservatives agree on. All Judge Dorow had to do was not fuck it up. The bar is so low for judges these days I understand why people were impressed. But the Supreme Court is full of nuanced cases and politics, and judge Dorow made it clear she would bring conservative insanity to that court and any rulings that allowed her own brand of judicial activism.
