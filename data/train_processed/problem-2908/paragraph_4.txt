Just like Tesla, a scam. Tesla’s fastest-growing business isn’t putting owners in its Model S and Model 3. It’s selling carbon credits to large automakers to avoid fines. As Tesla only sells electric cars, it receives these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other automakers who can't meet regulatory requirements. Tesla relies on large automakers to purchase credits from it. For example Stellantis bought about 2 billion euros ($2.43 billion) of European and U.S. credits from Tesla between 2019 and 2021. Eventually, however, Tesla won’t be able to rely on these credits as automakers begin producing their own EVs at scale.
