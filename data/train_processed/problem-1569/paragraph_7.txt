On its face, your comment reads as a legitimate take. However, while they can try to stop weapons sales to Taiwan, the US naval escorts would probably take issue with any attempt. If Taiwan wants weapons from LM or Raytheon (and they do, have received, and will keep receiving), the US will make sure they arrive. This isn’t some normal maritime shipment, we’re talking about shipments of high tech western weapons… c’mon.
