Fun fact! The purchase, possession, and consumption of cannabis in a public place in Spain is only a misdemeanour. you can get a fine and/or have it taken away. No criminal penalties. But you can legally grow your own and smoke your own in private as long as you're not growing it for sale. And in a lot of areas it's very tolerated and cops won't do shit even if you're smoking in public.
