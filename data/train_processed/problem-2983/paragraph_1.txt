If anyone wants to see what it looks like to die a slow death of smoking, come visit my parents. Who are in their early 70s/late 60s and can’t go up a flight of stairs without stopping at the landing. The thought of a long hallway terrifies them, which is every public venue and hotel in the world. They need to sit on a stool to fry an egg. And won’t visit my sisters house because of the stairs to enter it. They can no longer take care of their house, can’t play with their dog, and do nothing but sit and watch Tv and complain that no one wants to hangout when all they do is try to talk over the too loud Tv that no one is watching.
