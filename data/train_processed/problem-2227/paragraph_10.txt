Ignoring the obvious moral issues of slavery, I think it's less about keeping the wealthy happy (although that's an obvious side effect) and more about not having the economy collapse. If entire sectors (or at least substantial portions of them) ran on slave labor, such as farming in America pre-civil war, and one day slavery is suddenly outlawed; now you have severely impacted production of food, clothing, etc if the ex-slave owners can't begin paying wages to their workers. And that's not a sure thing from a business perspective, depending on how much of the slave owners' wealth is liquid, how much debt they have, etc.
