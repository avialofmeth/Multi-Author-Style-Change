My husband crawled into the hospital twice they're was no wheel chairs he was in so much pain..he laid on the floor while we waited...but because they need beds and need you in and out they give you pain medication and send you on your way. More people need to know (and now I do) that you need to demand testing. If they refuse you ask them to write in writing that they refused to test you for what you are experiencing and refused you treatment before they send you home.
