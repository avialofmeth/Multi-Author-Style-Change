    "feature1": {
        "explanation": "Both texts use commas and periods appropriately, but only Paragraph 2 includes hyphens and lacks quotation marks. However, punctuation style can vary based on the content and context of the text, so this difference may not be conclusive.",
        "score": 0.6
    },
    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit similar lexical and grammatical features, such as the use of pronouns ('I', 'we', 'you'), contractions ('I'm'), and simple sentence structures. However, Paragraph 2 shows slightly more variation in sentence structure with the inclusion of clauses.",
        "score": 0.7
    },
    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "In terms of sentence structure, both paragraphs contain simple and direct sentences. Paragraph 2 has slightly longer sentences and more varied sentence lengths compared to Paragraph 1. However, the overall coherence and cohesion are consistent in both texts.",

    },
    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit a similar tone and mood, conveying a helpful and informative stance. They both address the reader directly and use common expressions like 'please' and 'if you have any questions.' The narrative styles also align in their informative nature.",

    },
    "feature5": {
        "explanation": "There are no apparent spelling or typographical errors in either text, indicating a level of attention to detail in the writing. Both texts are free from mistakes that would suggest different authors.",

    "overall": {
        "explanation": "Considering the overall assessment of the five features, there are notable similarities in punctuation style, lexical and grammatical features, sentence structure, text and discourse features, and spelling and typographical errors. While there are some differences in punctuation and sentence structure, the consistent tone, coherence, and lack of errors suggest a moderate likelihood that the two texts were written by the same author.",
