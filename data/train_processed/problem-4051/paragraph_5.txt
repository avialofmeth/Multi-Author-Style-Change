I don't think Israel is unjustified in their desire for security either. However, it's hard to be sympathetic when the other side throws a rock so you fire back with a tank. They fire an RPG, so you launch an MLRS salvo. Somebody has to make the move to break this cycle of violence, and I don't think it's reasonable to expect it to be the most desperate party.
