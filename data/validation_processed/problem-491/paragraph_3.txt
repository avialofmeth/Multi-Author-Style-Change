I've been in therapy since I was 13 for anxiety and depression and given over 30 different meds over the years and nothing worked and finally I had to pay $4,000 for psychological testing and found out im autistic and adhd-c at 33. Finally getting with the right psychologist and psychiatrist and on the right meds. It isn't always easy. I still have to find the right ADHD med ad well as the right dose.
