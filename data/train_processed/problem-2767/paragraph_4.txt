Where do you suggest I look for this data? Would love to find a list of Arenas/Venues owned/operated by Ticketmaster/LiveNation to compare against arenas around the country, but such a list doesn’t seem to exist. If every venue is truly owned by TM, then we’re just fucked and it’s really sad. I’d be interested if you could prove that though, like I said I’d love to see the data.
