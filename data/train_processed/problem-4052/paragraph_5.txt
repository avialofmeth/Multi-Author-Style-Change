I love things that glow. Fortunately I have learned better and if I saw glowing dust and didn't know what it was, I wouldn't touch it. If I was younger though, I would've slathered myself in glowing dust or liquid with gusto! Not my face, because then I couldn't see it, but my arms, my clothes, etc.
