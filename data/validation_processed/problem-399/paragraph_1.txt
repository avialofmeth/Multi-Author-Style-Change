Yeah. Not to mention the vast majority of the military-industrial complex's corruption is out in the open. I mean, in the United States it's legal for transnational corporations to give money directly to elected officials for political purposes, as long as everybody files the right paperwork with the FEC. And egregious criminal behaviour often does get prosecuted. I don't see a strong argument that the US government is any softer on corruption at Lockheed or General Dynamics than they are on the big Wall Street banks or any other major industry in the US that's rolling in easy money.
