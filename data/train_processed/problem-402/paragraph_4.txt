What he doesnâ€™t get is we never in the history of ever attacked anyone because we wanted to help the people. There was a profit to be made. We help get shady terrible people elected that will line our politicians and corporate pockets. We make the rich so much richer after war profits are in. More of our tax money going for corruption instead of funding the betterment of our own people. Americans are paying the most and getting nothing back and you think suddenly our government gives two shits about brown foreigners? Right my guy right.
