So the question, to me, remains open. I don't really care that no one else is disputing it. Seems to me that the basic facts here remain unconfirmed, as the only party having ever confirmed them are, well, Vladimir Putin and his crony kleptocracy, which includes everyone from airport security to state-appointed lawyers.
