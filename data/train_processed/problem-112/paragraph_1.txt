It's very hard to put a specific percentage on it, because (1) the USSR's economy was non-market, other than where it interacted with the non-Communist world (e.g. selling oil). It had transfer pricing within its five year plans, but they were literally called something like "non-price prices". So all you can do is see the output and try to make a guess at what it would have cost to make it in a market economy. How do you put an accurate value on shitty Soviet consumer products (main cause of apartment fires in Moscow was TVs blowing up)? How do you put an accurate value on bizarre USSR military sh\t like the Caspian Sea Monster?
