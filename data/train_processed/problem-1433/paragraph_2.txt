I personally try not to make huge sweeping generalizations. Humans are to be blamed for breeding those dogs to be what they are today. I don't know how much dog fighting is still going on but there shouldn't be any more mainstream breeding programs for that. The aggression that was selectively bred for will eventually be naturally bred out. It's going to take a lot of time.
