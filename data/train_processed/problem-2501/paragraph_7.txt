The guy who owns FTX also owns a crypto hedge fund, which is how he is able to make investments/generate income outside the exchange. They wanted actual cash for various investments (which seem to have mostly been an insane advertising budget), but needed to show they had assets to use as collateral to get the loan. To do this, they created a crypto token on FTX called “FTT”, which was supposedly to be used as a method to help facilitate transactions between various tokens on the exchange (this in itself isn’t uncommon - Binance for example has their own coin, BNB).
