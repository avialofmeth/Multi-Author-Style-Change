I have lived around right wing Evangelical christians my entire life and I can guarantee you that they ARE NOT going to support a man who is married to a man regardless of what he claims. To them homosexuality directly draws Gods wrath. Milo is a troll and that's about it, I don't take anything he says seriously. He like Trump and Kanye just take controversial positions and say stupid shit for attention and infamy. They don't care why people are talking about them as long as they are talking about them, it's just a narcissistic brain disease.
