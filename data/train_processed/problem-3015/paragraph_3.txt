I was in 5th grade when this happened, the two 5th grade teachers at my school had applied to be the teachers on the flight, and had garnered a fair amount of community support in their pursuit. Neither advanced terribly far in the process, but both used the launch as a teaching tool that year. My entire class was watching as it blew up. I can still remember the looks on my teachers faces.
