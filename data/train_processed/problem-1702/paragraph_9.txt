Ive read the letter and Iâ€™m not sure I agree that this is draconian bullshit, though I do agree that malicious DAs looking to make political waves could intentionally misuse is. The problem with that is that I feel that way about every law that places anyone in criminal jeopardy. That will not stop being the case until we hold DAs accountable for intentionally violating the spirit of laws they intentionally misuse for their own gain. Nothing short of that will ever stop them from misusing their powers.
