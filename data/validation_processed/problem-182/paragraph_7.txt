Is this....supposed to be some type of cogent statement, or purely a rhetorical device? Is there actually a "thing that frustrates you about" logic which says that different people value things differently, or is that whole thing just a setup for your dime store Daily Show knockoff bit (which nails the tone almost precisely: it says absolutely nothing meaningful or in any way related to reality, but is very proud of itself for being sooo witty)?
