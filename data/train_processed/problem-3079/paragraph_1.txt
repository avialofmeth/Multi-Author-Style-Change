You should hear Action Bronson’s new single Black Pinot. He literally says “big Jews be remote controllin”. Yea, ye is being super loud and obnoxious, but I think he’s trying to shed light to a bigger issue. The bigger issue isn’t “ the Jews”, it’s capitalism itself. Power is super concentrated at the top of many industries. Obviously not ALL Jews hold this power, but they are the easiest group to identify. I have zero hate in my heart for anyone or any group. This isn’t a hateful post. Please don’t downvote.
