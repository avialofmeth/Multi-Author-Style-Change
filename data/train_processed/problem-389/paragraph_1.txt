At this point, literally years after Donald Trump committed an insurrection against his own country to try to stay in power he still walking around free and now pleasing his bid to try to run for president again. America deserves to be an authoritarian dictatorship run by the super rich 1% at this point. The people of this country are too fucking dumb and they deserve to be ripped off and shoved into the gutters to be forgotten about.
