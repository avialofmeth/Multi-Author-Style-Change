It’s the same game as the Roe shit, “we just want the states to decide”, then once overturned they start talking about national bans and wanting to thwart ballot initiatives by actual voters who decide to protect abortion. All that shit ever is is a very cheap attempt to pretend their goal to create an authoritarian right wing government is more limited than it actually is.
