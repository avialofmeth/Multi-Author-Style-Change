On the Chinese side the CCP doesn’t exactly have an objective auditor to cross check their books. So if the yuan is let’s say, 1000 to the USD or 10,000 to the USD, it doesn’t really matter if you are taking a long approach. You simply turn the money printing machines up to 10, nationalize any domestic Chinese business that can be used for control, and place an agent of the CCP in the C suite offices of any multinational company that does business in China.
