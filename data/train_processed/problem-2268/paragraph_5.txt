I've said for quite awhile now that once Americans actually get to know DeSantis they aren't going to like what they see. He's a very smarmy, needlessly hostile, cocky asshole. He's very much convinced that he's some kind of king that's going to rule America with an ultra right wing conservative iron fist. I don't think it's going to play very well across the country.
