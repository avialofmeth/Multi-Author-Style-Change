In the US, a Patriot battalion (600 people) consists of a headquarters battery, a maintenance company, between 4-6 line batteries, 6 launchers and 70 people per line battery, and 16 missiles per launcher. That means a battalion could effectively launch over 300 defensive missiles at once across all batteries.
