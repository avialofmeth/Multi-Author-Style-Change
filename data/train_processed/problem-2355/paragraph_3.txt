At this point, just giving up without any gains means his ouster and likely death so it's keep it going or nothing. As far as how he hopes to achieve that, the best case scenario for Russia is that Western countries stop funding Ukraine's defense through a combination of fatigue and a global recession that makes constantly sending out billions in aid far less palatable to those countries and their people. Ukraine is heavily dependent on Western aid. That happens and Russia manages to get the upper hand then Ukraine may see themselves backed into a corner where they don't have too much choice except to concede some territory or face millions of deaths.
