We've seen several cases of stuff like that happening in the Ukraine war too. Early on, Russia sent some kind of elite commando unit to take the airport in Kyiv. By all accounts they did the commando part of their mission well. But same thing as the USA... such a unit is not intended for protracted defensive combat in a fixed position. They might have been super stealthy, elite high mobility warriors or whatever, but when Ukraine knew they were coming, knew exactly where they were, and pinned them down... and there was no further support coming from Russia... that's not the commandos' wheelhouse, to say the very least.
