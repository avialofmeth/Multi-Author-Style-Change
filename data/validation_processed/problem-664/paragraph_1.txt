Also, that law professor either doesn't know the federal system or Times' editors incorrectly quoted him. The federal system requires a minimum of 85% incarceration. Prisoners may be transferred to a community home for the completion of their sentence or may be transferred to home confinement for completion of their sentences. However, that transfer would only cut into few months of Holme's incarceration in a BOP facility. Not years like the law professor opines.
