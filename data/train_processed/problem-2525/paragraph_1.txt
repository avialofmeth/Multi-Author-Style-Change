"Literally everyone" here means journalists and foreign governments. Within Germany, it is still a bit of a controversial decision - there's those that still fear escalation, of course, but mostly it's about the fact that it is a bit paradoxical that Germany is giving away a lot of its military stock (and unlike others, not from surplus, largely), while the Bundeswehr is already in a pretty bad state, and lots of money are being pumped into it as a result. Last known numbers (which are, admittedly a few weeks old) showed a relatively slim (somewhere around 55% - 65%, IIRC) majority for sending, but having a stable majority here is actually relatively new.
