What is interesting to me is that DeSantis overruled his own Republican controlled legislature and redrew Florida’s congressional districts, making them far more favorable to Republicans. I guess if a republican who wants to be reelected doesn’t feel like their legislature has given them enough of an unfair advantage, they can just re-draw districts?
