Fascism is more a means of taking power, which requires certain economic and governing conditions (failure of government and regulatory agencies). The result of fascism is often autocracy, oligarchy, or something in-between. What is fascist about this is the messaging, money, and special interests allowing people like DeSantis to gain popularity, and power.
