As someone who lives in Florida, the culture here is absolutely anathema to any kind of large infrastructural or public works project like that in a way that Dutch culture very much isn't. Everyone from engineers to inspectors to builders to the people approving the construction are as incompetent or crooked as they come, and projects like that would be actively protested and sabotaged every step of the way by the population at large.
