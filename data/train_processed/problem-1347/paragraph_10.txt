As for reasons, China is currently experiencing a period of escalating tensions with the US. The spy balloon is a prime example, but probably the US cutting off China's access to high grade computer chips is a much larger factor. It may be that China seeks to retaliate by undermining US interests in other places. Another factor will be that Russia will have been asking for more support for a long time, and it China might find it hard to continue to refuse while simultaneously touting their "boundless friendship". Lastly, a long and distracting war in Europe can be in China's favour (as long as it does not escalate) as it will drain resources from their strategic adversaries. Just as it is in the interest of the US/EU to arm Ukraine and thereby harm Russia, China could see it in their interest to arm Russia and harm the EU/US.
