I have almost got to the stage where I don't give a shit any more, I recycle everything, I buy items with less packaging, I insulated my house, I bought low powered cars which are much better of fuel, etc etc etc. Yet none of that makes even the slightest bit of difference as the goverments and corporations who actually can make a huge difference will do fk all because they will have to make a little less profit.
