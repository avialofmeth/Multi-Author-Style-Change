This is somewhat true. Only the people who have been fingerprinted, most identifing features archived and sometimes DNA samples taken are counted. Government officials say they are buried only after these are done. Ofc with how large the area is, there are some dead unofficially collected by their families who dug them out. Or the dead who is still under rubble. They will have to be registered dead at one point though, so after a few weeks we might get the actual final death toll.
