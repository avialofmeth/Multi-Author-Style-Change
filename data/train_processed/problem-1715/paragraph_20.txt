So I guess I understand that this will expand the number of court cases that can be processed by increasing the number of judges and prosecutors. But why does it need to be in a separate office? Why is it appointed by the State rather than by the residents of this newly expanded special district? So the affluent part of the city, which includes 80% of white residents, is being denied certain democratic rights to self-government?
