This is not the same plan. Then their plan was distance, so they sped past defenses and left themselves thin and flanked. Now the target is the defense troops themselves. They might fail, they might underestimate Ukraine, but itâ€™s not the same plan. And it could still bleed the fuck out of Ukraine. Putin can afford to hemorrhage. Ukraine cannot. I feel for their troops.
