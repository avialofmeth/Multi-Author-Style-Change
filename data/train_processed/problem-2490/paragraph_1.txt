Due to the overreach on the initial layoffs, current Twitter employees are in a pretty empowered position right now. Twitter is sinking and Elon removed the majority of the bilge pumps along with most people who know how to run the boat. He needs every hand on deck and canâ€™t afford to fire people giving 80% and telling him to fuck off from his return to the office edict. Curious to see how many return.
