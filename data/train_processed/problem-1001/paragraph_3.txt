Because there are "alternative facts" now, and you can't trust the media, unless the story has absolutely zero sources, aside from the original sources that had no proof whatsoever...like, "Fox news reporting, that Hannity reported, that Trump said something was 'fake news' and the alternative fact (a.k.a.- "The Truth") is COVFEFE" Then people have 3 "news" sources telling them "Well, it is definitely COVFEFE, for sure" And there's no point in fact-checking or correcting them, bc those people will never believe you...not if you don't speak "the truth" that they definitely know!
