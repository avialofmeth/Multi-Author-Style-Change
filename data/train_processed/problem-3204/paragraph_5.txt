Duterte was anti-everybody it seemed. He never made any sense and would frequently change his mind 180 degrees and make the most outlandish claims and quotes I have ever heard from any leader. It seemed as if he suffered from bipolar disorder. Anyway that guy was scary. A wannabe authoritarian populist.
