If you can take a step back from the hyper-partisan mindset, there's no ground lost in actually discussing how they voted for it. Calling republicans "the party of rape" doesn't quite jive with nearly half of them voting against it ( keep in mind, 4 democrats abstained, what kind of bad faith arguments should we hyperventilate in their direction? ), and 5 of them cosponsoring it. It's just twitter-level shit-flinging.
