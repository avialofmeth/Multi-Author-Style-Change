This isn't to say you can't or shouldn't try to understand a culture within its own context. You should. But there comes a point at which the abstract academic appreciation ends, and real decisions have to be made. Do you accept abhorrent behavior because it is part of a culture, or say, 'no, that's wrong', and start imposing your own values on others.
