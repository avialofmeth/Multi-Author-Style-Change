I'm sick and tired of the "Russia was cornered by US/West/NATO" narrative because it follows the "US & Russia are geopolitical superpowers" narrative too much where European countries are just their poker chips. Geopolitics always matter, but Russia should realize that times have changed, the cold war era is over and that this narrative has become ineffective and irrelevant.
