That's how its like in most Arab states, even the ones that have made peace with Israel. While the governments may cooperate with Israel, the population absolutely despises them and if any of the states were actually democratic, peace projects like the Abraham Accords would never be accepted. Something like 90% of Egyptians want to cut all diplomatic relations with Israel, and they've had a peace agreement for decades now.
