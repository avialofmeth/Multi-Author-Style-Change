Again, as an option it'd be great. With full drug legalization, I'd hope and expect harm reduction businesses to start up to offer safe environments. But I don't see any reason the government mandating this option is any better than the government staying out of people's consumption habits. If I'm at a party and want a line of coke, why should I have to leave, go to the hospital, wait, get my fix, and then...drive back to the party? Unless I'm not allowed to leave until I'm sober, in which case the only option is to break the law doing lines in the bathroom.
