Oh… I just got it.. I have been racking my brain trying to figure out why anyone would give a shit about stuff from almost 200 years ago… their identification is with those people. It was the last “heroes” their area produced that they could claim relation to _because they themselves haven’t done anything_. You can’t proudly lay claim to being the grandson of notable South Carolinian Andy McDowell… best you could do is maybe being distantly related to Chadwick Bosema… oh I see their problem….
