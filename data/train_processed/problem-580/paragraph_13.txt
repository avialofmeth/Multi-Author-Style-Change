It may be exactly what these MAGA extremist think it is, but I think throwing support behind McCarthy for some quid pro quo may not be the kind of support that will really help McCarthy lead the party. It gets him into power, but I think he's going to be removed from his position within a year....likely with some of these same MAGA nutjobs leading the call hoping to throw their own hat into the ring, and likely losing in the process.
