Of course, I wasn't you know defending the ottomans, they are pure evil, caused many genocides including the famous armenian genocide because they thought they were going to secede and decided just to slaughter them, which worked out in the end as they fell. I was saying , the allied could have helped make a new 1 unified government system based on how the tribal system was, I don't much of it as I wasn't raised in the middle east but in america as a middle eastern from lebanon that I never hope to step in that country as I rather abandon my culture and traditions. Like the allied could have done so much more to the middle east but they just decided to seperate it into smaller countries just for oils and greed and hope for the best.
