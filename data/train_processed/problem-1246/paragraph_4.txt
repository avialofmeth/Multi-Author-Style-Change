You buy remnants of memory foam from factories that make mattresses and actual high quality pillows, then you shred them and put them in a cheap cotton casing, and then run infomercials touting their health benefits and so on, and sell them at $100 apiece. And when the FTC fines you a few million for false health claims and for not honoring your warranty/return guarantees, then you pay the fines and keep laughing all the way to the bank.
