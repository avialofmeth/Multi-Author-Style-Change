I meant infected in the sense of the virus entering your body. Vaccines do not stop a virus from entering your body. What they do is allow your body to gain the ability to fight off a virus. Some vaccines are effective enough that the virus is killed by the body before the virus has a chance to cause the body to show any symptoms of infection. That is what immunity is. You are immune from the effects of the virus. Also, your body may be able to kill the virus before it can be transferred to another host. Obviously, some viruses like influenza, and covid, reproduce and evolve at such a rapid rate that the antibodies created by the body in response to a vaccine to deal with the virus are no longer effective against new variants and additional vaccination is required.
