I am not going to defend the actions of the individual terrorists who attack Israel, but simultaneously you have to wonder if any group of people would be behaving differently in their shoes? Their rights have been stripped, the international courts won't help, their neighboring Muslim countries won't help, except for Iran who will give them weapons to fight as a proxy against the people who are slowly driving them from their ancestral homeland.
