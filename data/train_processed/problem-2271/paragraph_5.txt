No problem. It's gonna be messy since Erdogan is up for elections in May with elections seen as a real test on his 20 years of rule. Coincidently, this happening in 99 is what led to his predecessors fall politically and his rise. The fact that 20 years plus special taxes to address this does not seem to have worked as one would expect there will be hard questions. If it comes to light that recent buildings have collapsed disproportionately more than older ones that brings up potential accusations of bribery to get projects approved by government. Ugly, Ugly.
