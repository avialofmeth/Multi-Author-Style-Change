It’s pure insanity how stupid Putin has over played his hand. He had most of the World fooled as even the experts in the West thought his army was 2nd best in world. Not even counting becoming a pariah state, losing all the economics losses from KIA/ Russians who fled, completely destroyed his main export in gas (potentially)… also pretty much made sure more countries won’t be buying Russians weapons. Sure there will be poor countries/ countries that bared from buying more advanced weapons from the West, but damn what an idiot this guy is. Putin didn’t just shoot himself in the foot, he has practically built and started to wrap the noose around his own neck.
