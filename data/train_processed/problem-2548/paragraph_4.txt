My uncle is super pissed off that my cousin's wife is staying home and not working. Childcare is so expensive she doesn't think it is worthwhile. She was making 12 an hour, and childcare was eating around 700 a month, after taxes she was spending half of her time working just to pay for childcare. My cousin was vocally against it until he figured out that with her clipping coupons, not driving, not eating lunch out every day etc., they actually have nearly the same spending money.
