This is a case that I often remember when dealing with genetically modified products The issue is not whether or not they are better crops, the issue is the intellectual property that these large companies hold. Monsanto suing a small farmer for using genetically modified canola crops, went through the years and years of litigation before landing in the Canadian Supreme Court. Although Schmeizer was eventually found guilty of using the Monsanto crops by 5 to 4 margin, any monetary damage by Monsanto was nullified. Schmeiser maintained the whole time that he never used, purchased, or bought genetically modified seeds from Monsanto, and that the crops obtained the genetic traits strictly due to pollen from adjacent fields of other farmers.
