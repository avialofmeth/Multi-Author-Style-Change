Uh, the biggest problem with your statement is thinking Taiwan would just hand over its state-of-the-art facilities intact. They’d sooner destroy them than give them freely to an invading China… or that the US wouldn’t do so themselves before seeing the tech fall into the hands of an authoritarian CCP regime. It would simply be a scorched earth move from China, there’s no “FORCING” they can do to the West. China knows damn well they aren’t going to get keys to the factory and a neat little complimentary instruction manual under the pillow after committing genocide on Taiwan.
