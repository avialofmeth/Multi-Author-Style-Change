As long as Dems in Congress still did all that stuff, idk what difference a different head of the DNC would make. It's not like the DNC is actually a particularly powerful organization. And while maybe Obama could have guided the party to fewer losses if he governed in a more bipartisan manner, would that be worth it? Would it have been worth it to swuander the chance of getting big policy done?
