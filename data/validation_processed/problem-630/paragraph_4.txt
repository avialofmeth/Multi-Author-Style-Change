still is disappointing that everytime you see news about soft robotic or metal robots that its clickbait.. you always need huge external hardware that makes it not useable in any real reallife usecase.. this researchers just burn money and time and act like they just invented the new big thing.. but then its just a floppy piece of rubber they inflate with a compressor or a piece of metal they move by magnets. its just.. sigh.. :/.
