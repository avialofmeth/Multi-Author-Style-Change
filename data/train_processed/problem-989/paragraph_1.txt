I feel so bad for Fauci. He was loved by everyone up until covid. There was some bad blood between aids activists in the 80s and Fauci sat with them, listened to their concerns. I wish I could find the exact quote, but someone high in the movement hated Fauci with a passion. Now he says he credits him for the good he has done and has the utmost respect for him. Fauci saved the lives of the doctors and nurses who were flown to the NIH with ebola. Him personally. Not overseeing treatment but being in a spacesuit risking his own life. At 74 years old. Then a walking talking Cheeto came along and turned so many against him.
