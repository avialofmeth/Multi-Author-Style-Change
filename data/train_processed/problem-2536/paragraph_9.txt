Real world corporations are a legal framework to create jobs and a living. Anyone that compares that to the government and their mafias building buildings illegally that get people killed are just not being realistic. The companies that get away with it are linked to Erdogan's government, they aren't a regular construction company taking pride in their work as builders. If you go talk with a large swathe of builders you'll realize that most of them want to be proud of their work, and most are organized in corporations. They want good marketing, good reviews, and safety is part of that. Erdogan's party's mindset is to loot as much as possible from anyone that doesn't support their view of the world. These guys work hand in hand with ISIS and other jihadist groups. They're murderous savages looking to genocide Kurds and Armenians, and kill anyone who isn't Muslim enough. Don't compare small business with that. Big corporate greed like Dole and their coups are bad but never caused this much damage over this amount of time. Hundreds of deaths for greed vs thousands, millions for government cronyism and ideology.
