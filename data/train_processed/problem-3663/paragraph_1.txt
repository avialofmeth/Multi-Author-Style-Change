Thanks for this clarification. The headline is subject to misinterpretation. “Replacing Pelosi” is ambiguous since Pelosi had two titles: House Majority Leader and Speaker of the House. No one is suggesting the Democrats choose a Republican to be the new leader of their caucus. Instead, the article argues they should nominate some Republican less nuts than McCarthy to be Speaker. Think of it this way, if they nominate one of their own to run against McCarthy for the job they will surely lose. The option in the article has a slight chance of shaking things up. If it fails the Democrats still have their own minority leader.
