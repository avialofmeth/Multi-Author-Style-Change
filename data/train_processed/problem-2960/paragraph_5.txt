Also the fact that you claim the black september was started by palestinians trying to take over jordan shows that you only heard about it from anti palestinian sources, it was started an organization led by nayef hawatmeh (jordanian of a family that lived in salt for millennials) tried to assassinate the king, hawatmeh was supportive of palestinian left wing parties and ended up dragging them along with the entirety of the plo, most of the plo fighters refused to fight and ended up surrendering and they were released soon afterwards, the man who led the gov responsible for the crackdown on hawatmeh and the plo on the other hand was a palestinian from a familt well known across the arab world, the head of the intelligence was also palestinian and half of the army was made up of palestinians, at the time there was a higher anti monarchist sentiment from jordanians while most palestinians to this day view the monarchy favorably even the ones outside jordan .
