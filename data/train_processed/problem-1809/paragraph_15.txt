There is already a Greek state, though. The problem is that the Jews were stateless and without self-determination. Centuries of being a minority in diaspora proved not to be working. The reestablishment of Israel was done out of necessity. Giving Turkish land to Greeks would not be out of necessity, so it's an extremely inappropriate comparison. Same goes for Russia/Ukraine.
