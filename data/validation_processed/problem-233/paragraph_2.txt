It's clear in hindsight that Reagan's policies were poorly designed. There just wasn't enough reliable data to call it in advance. A lot of people did call it, but there just wasn't enough real data to say for certain. I think that something like what Reagan did would have been a good idea given the problems face at the time, but not specifically what he did.
