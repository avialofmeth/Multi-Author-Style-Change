And if you are instead talking about the Heritage foundation plan, that was a GOP compromise plan, one they immediately threw away when it was clear universal healthcare was so despised that they didn't actually need any alternative to the status quo. But also, that Heritage plan merely shared some similarities to the ACA, largely the individual mandate. It also was very different from the ACA in a lot of ways - for example, it lacked the Medicaid expansion, which was the largest part of the ACA reduction in uninsurance, and covered about 10 to 15 million people all by itself. That alone makes the ACA a way more liberal bill than the Heritage plan ever was. Some folks act like the fact that the ACA had an individual mandate like the heritage plan did means they are basically the same thing, but the individual mandate was a relatively minor part of the bill that didn't end up actually mattering. Doesn't make sense to give it that much attention or to use it to wrongly act like the ACA is a GOP policy because it shared a couple similarities with one.
