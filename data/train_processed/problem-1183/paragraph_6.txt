I hope this war ends soon, and I hope Russia leaves Ukraine for good. I hope Putin suffers a fatal stroke yesterday. But I also hope that this eventually prompts a more... inclusive, if difficult, discussion about the responsibilities of nuclear powers to not start murderous wars on ridiculous pretexts. But at the moment, Russia is just acting out the lesson of the past seventy years: a nuclear arsenal means you can do whatever the you want. America taught them that lesson more than anyone else. To get some idea of how hard it is going to be to un-teach that lesson, we might consider how hard it would be to un-teach it to America itself.
