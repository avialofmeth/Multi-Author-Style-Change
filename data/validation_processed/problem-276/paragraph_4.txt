There was an ill pigeon in my garden and I called the vets for advice, also mentioning my concern about bird flu. I was told to bring the bird in, which surprised me So I caught it (wearing gloves) and took it over. Obviously the vet put it to sleep and I asked if it could be bird flu- his answer was 'yes, it could be. Why, are you worried?' I was like, well, it's bird flu.
