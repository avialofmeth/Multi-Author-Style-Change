I really don’t have much haha. It’s in a gated community and a ton of the house are giant McMansions. His behavior was pretty typical of the people there so he was just one of dozens. Only reason that stuck out was because he specifically talked about his quality of life being jeopardized like I wasn’t making minimum wage and living in a roach infested apartment at the time. He was rude as shit most of the time too. I saw a smear campaign of his talking about how harder is just trying to get rich. Says the guy living like a king. I stopped working there like 2 years ago so hopefully I won’t hear from him again.
