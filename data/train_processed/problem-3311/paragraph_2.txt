Sad thing is, society's dumdums will look at this like the government is still covering for someone instead of realizing it is probably more for medical or security concerns. Some people don't grasp the government isn't as "evil" as they want to think. This goes for both sides. Most of the reason the left and right don't get along is media manipulation to a huge degree across the board. The JFK assassination was a more than just a single terrible event in our country's history. It spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories. If this does turn out to be anything more than what is already known (by that I mean more than one shooter and Oswald as a patsy type stuff) then I can admit when I'm wrong.
