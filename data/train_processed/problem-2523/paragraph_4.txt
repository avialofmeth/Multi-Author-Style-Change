We need sensible gun regulations in this country. But this shit will back-fire and promotes fundamental misunderstanding, and while I do not believe the 2nd Amendment outlaws sensible restrictions, this is overreach this is unlikely to stand. Semi-automatic is far too broad of a classification. That's basically any pistol that isn't a revolver, as well as a many hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns. "Semi-automatic" isn't some crazy military technology, it's just the way regular-ass guns have worked for like a hundred years. I have a .22LR varmint rifle that's semi-automatic, for Christ's sake. All it's good for is shooting pop cans or if I have the bad luck to have a sick small animal in my yard and I need to take care of it.
