Ukraine firing a Russian made mistake seems sus. My guess is a false flag op to draw NATO into direct conflict with Russia or Russia accidentally/provokingly fired the middle and NATO is scared to acknowledge it because they donâ€™t want to engage directly with Russia. Just a guess, but I have a hard time believing the Ukrainians were firing Russian missles, accidentally hit Poland, then blamed Russia publicly.
