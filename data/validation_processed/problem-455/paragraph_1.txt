I think that what people like yourself don’t grasp about being an undermined minority in a capitalist system, like ours, is that such minorities are not responsible, at least not to the same standards as wealthy, white, heterosexual-passing men, for what they have to do to make ends meet, which equates in said system with getting ahead. It’s the luck of the draw for such minorities. So, I think that’s her excuse, which I personally will allow since she has made recent strides in a more ethical direction with her brave testimony. I agree with you, it is a tragic waste of human potential—living within the capitalist death grip, as such.
