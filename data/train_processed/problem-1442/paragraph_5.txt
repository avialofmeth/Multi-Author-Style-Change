I think this is going to backfire disastrously on the Republicans if they issue a pro-ISL decision regardless of how extreme or “moderate” it is. 2014 is long gone, and these midterms show as much. Republicans actually have to worry about voters now and their internal factions are at each others’ throats. Moore v. Harper is not going to save them from that.
