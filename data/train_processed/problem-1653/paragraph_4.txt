I believe they could also change the rule for electing a speaker to say move to a plurality, but that would be very risky for the Republicans since Jeffries has the plurality right now and I would not be surprised if the 20 decide to call the McCarthy backers bluff since they could likely remove Jeffries later and restart the whole fight.
