The CPC sees itself as the rightful successor of the Qing Empire, having reunified the mainland after a long era of warlordism and internal struggle. Taiwan was given back to China (the RoC at that moment) in 1945, while they retreated to Taiwan island shortly after, before the PRC was officially established. Taiwan would most likely have been reunified already if it wasn't given foreign support/foreign interference.
