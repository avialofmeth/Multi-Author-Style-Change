I don’t like being fetishized. I wish white dudes would stop. I’m not exotic sex meat. I’m just a person. Literally every group of people has beautiful people. I’m only half and (usually white) men still do this. It’s not just a generic “you’re pretty” either. It’s a whole host of comments that’s creepy Othering.
