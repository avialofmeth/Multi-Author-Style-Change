You’d be surprised how little control the CCP actually has on North Korea. North Korean regime will gladly tell the CCP to fuck off if they are threatened with denuclearization and withdrawal of support. Why? North Korea simply just does not give a shit about its people like we assume they do. That’s why sanctions don’t work on North Korea. Millions of North Koreans could die due to starvation and they won’t even lift a finger.
