Second-this needs to be the Liberals resounding primary message from here on out. This has to be one of the most important messages to get out, not that everything else is not important, but all that other stuff like womenâ€™s rights, the economy, equal rights, the environment, climate change, our democracy etc. means nothing without the right people in Congress prioritizing these goals as well, this is the key to getting substantive change for people who really need it-not a party who has zero platform and is diametrically opposed to these changes.
