I'm not sure I completely agree with that framing. I think the GOP lost control of itself when it decided to not be reality based, things like trickle down economics etc and their voters got comfortable being outside a reality based world view. Fox just dialed that up to 11, but the Brief documents how even they know they only have the tiger (GOP voters) by the tail and risk losing viewer/money by trying to inject reality into their reporting.
