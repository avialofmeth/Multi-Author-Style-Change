As for apartheid being a too strong a word for the situation in Israel? Desmond Tutu lived under the Apartheid of South Afrika and was one of the most prominent activists against Apartheid. He even got a Nobel Peace Price for his efforts. If someone who suffered under Apartheid and fought against it says what's happening in Israel is Apartheid, then I don't see why I can't say the same.
