Now as far as a waste of time outside of that? No not really. Even though nothing came of shit like the Benghazi hearings, they got a lot of right wing traction and I believe most right wingers still hold onto it and point to it as something of substance. It's not about actually getting something out of the hearings it's about pushing a narrative of the dems do this, so they can then turn around and do it themselves and their base eating it up. "well the other side is doing it(they're not), so why can't our side do it!".
