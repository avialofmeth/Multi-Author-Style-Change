> Stephen Moore, also known as Steve Moore, has been employed by many conservative groups in various roles such as "Senior Fellow," "Visiting Scholar" and "Senior Economist." He founded the Club for Growth and has served on the Wall Street Journals editorial board. Moore is frequently referred to as an "economist" in the media, despite pushback from tenured professors of Economics due to his lack of a Ph.D. in the subject.[1] Moore was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by President Trump in March 2019,[2] but withdrew his name "amid revelations about decades' worth of disparaging comments Moore has made about women.".
