While I absolutely agree, as the Bible is there biggest work of fiction out there, I don't think we need to question if the physical description is accurate or not. In every other fiction book we don't question if that's what a character really looks like - Alice in Wonderland is described as having blonde hair, Snow White had skin as white as snow, etc. We never questioned or doubted what those fake books described, why do you think this fake book is inaccurate about what the fictional character looked like? It gave a literal description of what he physically looks like, why do you not know if that's "true" while never questioning if every other fictional character actually looks like the way they were described?
