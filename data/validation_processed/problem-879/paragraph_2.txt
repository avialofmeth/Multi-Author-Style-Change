I used to work for a company that made safety instrumentation for oil and gas, ie pressure, temperature, flow, and level sensors. Most of which are used around the world in refineries and transportation systems like pipelines and terminals. Most of these refineries are automated so having working sensors is extremely important in the safety feedback loop.
