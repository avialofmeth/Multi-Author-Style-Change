I know this isn't a great source but my friend is one of the soldiers that man the S400's. During his boot camp he explained how some soldiers asked the sergeant where the prayer room was and the sergeant went to town on that soldier. My friend is a staunch nationalist to the degree that he is trying to revive the old Turkic religion of Tengriism. He says that the military is still very secular but high officials closest to Erdogans position are probably filled with his cronies who have had secular military training.
