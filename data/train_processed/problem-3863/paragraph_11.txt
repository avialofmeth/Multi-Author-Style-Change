Given that there are tribal casinos all over the country at this point. I don't see the point in making gambling illegal in any state. Is there a place left in the country where you aren't at most a 2 hour drive from being at a black jack table or slot machine? Anyone that wants to gamble doesn't exactly have to work hard to find it.
