Is this a major Ukrainian request? Germany has Leopards, the UK is encouraging Germany to send some. For instance, I'd say Germany sends minimum of 50 through 2023, but makes sure that Finland, Poland, Canada, Spain, Sweden e.t.c also send some amount as well. I still don't see your issue here. Ukraine wants heavy tanks badly, the best fit are Leopards, but Abrams are good, too.
