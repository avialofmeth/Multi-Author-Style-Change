Just to give a little bit of context, the group that organized this vigil is an anti-government group that has been holding anti-government rallies even last week. Most of these people don't care about the deaths and they're just using the disaster and the victims to push their political agenda which is quite frankly, disgusting. Calling this protest "South Korea Demands" is akin to calling Qanon protesters "United States protests".
