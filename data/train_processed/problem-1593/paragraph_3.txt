Belarus has limited military capability and very real risk of forces defying attack orders - this would be a disaster scenario for Lukashenko. Both himself and Putin are aware of that. He will also not be killed by Putin, who obviously does not care about literally anyone, problem is Lukashenko being killed will open void for pro European movement in Belarus, Putin will struggle with managing this in a peaceful manner and may struggle with using force too.
