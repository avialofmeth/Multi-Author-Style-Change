People forget Russia was an Axis power as well... Kinda also gets forgotten since they get this 'faux redemption arc' in history cause they were ultimately betrayed by Germany and ended up fighting alongside the US and the Allied powers before the war ended. Like you're saying it shouldn't be undermined they supported all that landgrabbing/genocidal behavior Hitler was on so long as they weren't the one's getting invaded and benefitted from it.
