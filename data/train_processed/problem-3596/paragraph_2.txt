Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles. Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds). Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
