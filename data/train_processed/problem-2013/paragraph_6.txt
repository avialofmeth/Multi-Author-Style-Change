This is a very recent history, Russia in the late 80s/early 90s negotiated with NATO and the Western democracies to disband on the premise that the West would not move NATO any further East than Germany. Every single US president has broken that agreement by allowing more former soviet states to join NATO. Obviously, there is a big difference between allowing a country into a treaty organization and invading a neighbor, but to look at the conflict from 2014 onward is disingenuous at best. Both the West and the Russians have major culpability in this conflict, and when you look at the last 33 years, it seems like it was inevitable. I am in no way saying that any of this should have happened, but if Russia made a treaty deal with Canada or Mexico and set up bases and provided weapons, we would not be jazzed about it. Especially if we saw it slowly happening over 30+ years and it reached a tipping point.
