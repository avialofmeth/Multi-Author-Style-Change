2. Push back Ukraine from the outskirts of Donetsk/Luhansk, to ensure major Russian-held cities are out of range of Ukrainian artillery. This was a goal from day 1, but the Ukrainian defenses along the Toretsk-Avdiivka-Mariinka line have proved virtually impenetrable. The fall of Bakhmut might provide encirclement opportunities, or at least flanking pressure that could make Ukraine withdraw from their most fortified positions in the entire war. I don't think Russia has any steam left to take Slovyansk/Kramatorsk, their current goal is a border lying somewhere roughly equally between Donetsk/Luhansk and those cities.
