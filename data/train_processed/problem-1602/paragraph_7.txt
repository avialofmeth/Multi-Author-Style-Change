Republicans tolerated Trump's very overt racism, bigotry, fraud, and even his fucking violence and treason... so long as they believed that he guaranteed them power. Now that Trump is not a guaranteed path to power the Republicans are trying to pretend that they have any scruples to speak of; this is theater. If the current shifts and Combover Caligula becomes their best means of gaining power in 2024, they'll suddenly all be back on board with him and all of his bullshit and they absolutely will not give a shit about it.
