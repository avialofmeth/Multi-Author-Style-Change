It's super fucked that they're explicitly targeting books that merely portray the lives of minorities and communities removed from their own. I'd say that, as someone who's planning on being a parent in a few years, I'd have my kids read some of these books on their own, outside of school, the problem is that there are some in these groups reaching the extreme to where they want to call it child abuse to expose kids to books and events they're actively against.
