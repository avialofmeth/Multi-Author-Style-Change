I am just going to focus on helping the people around me, helping my family, and doing my part to make the world better in small ways. My goal is to do what little I can before everything collapses. As a whole, humanity deserves to be ground into the dirt. It's sad, but we fucked up. Bad. So much potential wasted, so much selfish, ignorant destruction. One can only hope that out of this absolute childish self-destruction will be born a new civilization. Something like the Star Trek universe post WWIII and Eugenics wars. Laugh at me, but the state of things doesn't lie.
