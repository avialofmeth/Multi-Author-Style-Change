Anti-ballistic missile treaties have prevented nations from deploying (but not developing a'la Regan's $60bn Star Wars program) defense systems. However, that ended 20 years ago (thanks Dick Cheyn - I mean Dubya). This being said - there is only so much you can do to prevent a warhead traveling at mach 8 on it's way in, much less 50 missiles containing a dozen warheads each. This is a physics problem and there are no cheat codes or clever solutions. It's like trying to hit a bullet with another bullet, while blindfolded, riding a horse.
