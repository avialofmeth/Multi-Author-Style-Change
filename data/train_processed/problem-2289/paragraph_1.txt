What happens next is we pay the bills and raise the artificial debt ceiling like we always have. This two Santas bullshit needs to stop. There is no negotiating with people who only negotiate in bad faith. Republicans demand concessions and want a cookie to do their job, then fail to do the same when the shoe is on the other foot. The playbook is clearly written and published now, Dems aren't going to play ball. The media is complicit in playing this game because it makes for compelling headlines.
