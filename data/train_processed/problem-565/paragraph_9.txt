I should note; I don’t think all Russians are like this. I have met Russians that were perfectly nice people. But what I observed on that holiday, they behaved more like inmates on a sabbatical from prison than regular tourists. Every once in a while I would get in an elevator and an American or Canadian in the elevator would be like “how do you like the Russians so far?” As they shook their head in disappointment. It was a unique experience.
