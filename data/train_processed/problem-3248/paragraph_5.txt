I dont think a person with no interest should be forced to take, and pay, for classes in art and philosophy just to get a job in physical therapy. I know having a basic level of liberal arts education seems like a good idea, but I've lived long enough to realize forcing people to do, and pay, for things they don't want to do never works out. They won't actually learn anything. I do, however, think a physical therapist should absolutely be able to take classes in art and philosophy if they want to and they shouldn't have to take out a loan to do so.
