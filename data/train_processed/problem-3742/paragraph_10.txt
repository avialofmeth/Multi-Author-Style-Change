Agreed! A few Americans have definitely made great sacrifices for the Kurdish people. But if the Kurds saw just a fraction of the committed support that Ukraine for example is seeing, they would be independent by now. There have been so many significant opportunities to provide that, or at the very least to prevent their genocide, and these have all gone wasted. It's frustrating-- there are so many examples of stateless exploited people that have no hope of gaining determination-- but the Kurds have had genuine, realistic potential to achieve their freedom and nothing but their mountains will stand for them.
