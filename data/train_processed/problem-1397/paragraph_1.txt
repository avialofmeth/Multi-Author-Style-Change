Yeah Ukraine should just bend over and take some Russian peace I’ve been reading lately about the events that led to WW2 starting and placating Germany by allowing them to take over Czechoslovakia without a shot being fired just emboldened them to invade Poland and other countries. It’s unfortunate that Russia has displayed the same tactics with regards to Chechnya, Georgia and the Crimean annexation. Their military isn’t all it’s cracked up to be so one wonders if the Ukraine invasion would have come to pass if Russia had been held accountable earlier on. Unfortunately the US had other concerns since 9/11 and Chechnya and Georgia were strategically not worth much to US interests.
