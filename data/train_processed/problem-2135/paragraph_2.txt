Asking courts to overthrow election results, a hitherto untried approach to politics. Interesting to consider the extent to which this could adversely affect other Republican politicians who don't come out against Lake's foolishness/craziness. That'd be in general elections; backing Lake would have no down side in Republican primaries.
