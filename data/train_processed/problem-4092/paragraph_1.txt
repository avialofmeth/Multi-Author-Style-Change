well, german defence minister is alsmost always a career killer. the bundeswehr is full of problems (old equipment broken, planes grounded, tanks breaking down, the sailboat refit going way over budget, spent millions on new guns that don't shoot straight) and scandals (if not neo-nazis in the special forces again, then at least bizarre demeaning "rituals" or soldiers posing as refugees requesting asylum to get social benefits), and defence ministers always get to take their hat over it. i think von der leyen was the only one in the last 30 years that had a significant post after being defence minister, because she switched to become eu comissioner in time.
