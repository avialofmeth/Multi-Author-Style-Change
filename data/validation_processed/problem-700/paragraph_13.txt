Safe allowance for Jews to Joseph's tomb? Nope, everytime terrorists shoot the soldiers accompanying the incoming Jews who just want to pray, and throw dozens of molotovs each week (the video from this week you just see literally fire driving around because of so many molotovs). Acknowledging Israel's right to exist? Nope. Stopping terrorists? Happen, but barely and probably more for the own benefit. They have a rule of paying blood money to terrorists who are jailed in Israel for killing a civilian.
