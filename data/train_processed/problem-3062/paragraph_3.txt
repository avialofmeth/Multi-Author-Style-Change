I recall reading somewhere recently that for Ukraine to effectively take the initiative and go on the offensive in the spring they’d need another 2 armoured divisions minimum. Seeing all the news about any armour from modernized T55s, to Bradley’s, to French light tanks headed their way it seems like they’re trying to scrape together everything with tracks and a cannon to get the fight going.
