This isn't an attack on democratic institutions. If you want to be strict about it, the Knesset is the democratically elected institution and it's trying to grab power from the courts. If anything, it's a power grab for democracy. The problem is that such a power grab allows a tyranny of the majority. So it needs to be better fleshed out than what is proposed. What Israel really needs is a constitutional convention.
