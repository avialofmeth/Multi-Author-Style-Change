This was a very predictable outcome. US boycotted Turkey's decision to buy S400s from Russia by kicking them out of the F35 program and banned the sale of F16s. Ever since then, Turkey has been eager to get back to get these systems. Sweden and Finland's desire to join NATO was seen as a perfect time to press for these demands. I wouldn't be surprised if Erdogan tries to get Turkey back in the F35 program too.
