Biden's a decent improvement, obviously foreign policy never changes because only billionaires, weapons manufacturers, and the elite criminals who hold sway over the CIA have a say in that. I hate the fucker but if I'm being honest he's the best President of my lifetime, and of most people still alive. Which is fucking harrowing.
