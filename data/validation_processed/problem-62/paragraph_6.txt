Throughout the world, countries with strict guns laws have greatly reduced gun violence. The problem in this case is handguns (which are illegal in Canada) being smuggled into Canada. These and other guns can be purchased at open markets in some states without registering. There is more gun violence in the USA in a day than in a year in Canada so yes, gun laws do work. Will it stop all gun violence. Of course not, but watching children being slaughtered in the USA almost daily is sickening and the only ones winning are the NRA and the gun manufacturers who line the pockets of cowardly politicians.
