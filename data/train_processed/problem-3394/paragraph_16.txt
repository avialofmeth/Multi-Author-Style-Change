Promised but may not be able to deliver. IF they can muster the 218 votes to create a select committee for one of these performative investigations (which I doubt they could), the committee will only have a GOP majority of one member. If any member can't make the meeting, they'll have to call it off or postpone it. It'll be a scheduling nightmare.
