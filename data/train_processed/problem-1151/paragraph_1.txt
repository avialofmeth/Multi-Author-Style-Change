It's by design. The first wave of fascism actually had a lot of backing by a class of fascist "intellectuals," afluent and educated extremelly conservative individuals developing fascist theories and extablishing the ideology from 19th century racial "science" and ideas of nationalism, this made fascism more appealing to aristocratic/business classes across the world, which feared the specter of socialist movements.
