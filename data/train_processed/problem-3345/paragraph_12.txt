I'm Jewish and will frequently criticize the Israeli government. Can people criticize Israel in an antisemitic way? Definitely. Some people might hear I'm Jewish and then criticize me for the actions of the Israeli government. This despite the fact that I'm an American citizen and have never even been to Israel - much less have any sway in the Israeli government. It would be about the same as criticizing me for Russia's actions because my ancestors 3 generations back came from Russia.
