There's a lot of paralells between fascist activity in the US then and now. Pelley's Silvershirts and the Christian Front have a lot in common with the Proud Boys/3 Percenters/Oathkeepers of our day, as do Tucker Carlson and Father Caughlin (the most popular propagandist of that era). There's also a lot of similarity between law enforcement being slow to recognize these groups as a threat for various reasons. A key difference though is that last time this stuff sprung up, there wasn't a presidential administration actively stoking the flames like Trump did.
