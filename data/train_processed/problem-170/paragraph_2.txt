You mean the useless party that just took over control of the House where all investigations originate and proceed? Kiss J6 Committee goodbye and probably every investigation at federal level regarding attempted overthrow of the US Government in 2021. Now standby for investigations against everyone who gave negative testimony against the Trump administration. Investigations against that mysterious Hunter Biden laptop that never materialized. Investigations against Biden withdrawing from Afghanistan by May 1st of 2021 as Trump arranged in 2020 with the Taliban he released from prison then reduced US forces from 13,000 to 2500 closing all but one US airbase in Afghanistan. Yeah good job people the Senate is important but the House controls ALL budgetary spending and investigations so kiss ANY progress goodbye until 2025, if then.
