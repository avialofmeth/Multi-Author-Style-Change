Perhaps even weirder are the claims Santos reportedly made about his professional network. According to the Post, he said he had a “personal relationship” with the CEO of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a.k.a. CalPERS, a.k.a. the largest public pension fund in the country. He also said he was going to win a multimillion-dollar investment from the agency, on top of the six deals he’d previously worked on with it. (Not surprisingly, CalPERS denied all of this and told the Post that no one by the name of George Santos or George Devolder had “any relationship with the pension fund’s CEO.”).
