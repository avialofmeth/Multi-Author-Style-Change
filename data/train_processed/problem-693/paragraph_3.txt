I understand the “concern” of the Senators. Nursing Homes are way understaffed especially Nursing Assistants. I worked five years in one. I was an RN in one for five years before quitting nursing just as Covid hit. We had twenty five-thirty residents each as an RN, many were LPNs. Most all were very competent. When well staffed with assistants our job was easier and Residents received fine care.
