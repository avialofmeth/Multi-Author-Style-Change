Look dude, I get it. The easiest solution would obviously be "no Russia", and the most feasible way for that to happen is the federation breaking apart, however I just don't see that happening, especially since it would be very beneficial for oil-rich parts while the parts where it's nothing but tundra would basically get nothing and be even poorer.
