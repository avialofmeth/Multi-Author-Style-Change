If israel got the same results as we have then the conflict is over, there is no more conflict, our mistake was allowing parties to be armed being to easy on their transgressions on the sovereignty while no one would think it was about if palestinians should have had citizenship, also palestinians were much better educated and were much better at trade and manufacturing so i hate to admit it but they are the ones to make this country turn from a desert not worth occupying into the most advanced and educated country jn the arab world.
