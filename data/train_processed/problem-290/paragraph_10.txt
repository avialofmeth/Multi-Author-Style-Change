They may end up taking the path of dictatorship again no matter what we do. Note that this isn't the same as the "those people are literally incapable of doing free democracy and peaceful foreign policy" argument that some people make. Just that there can be aspects that make things far from certain - even if the west took a policy that was very friendly to Russia. So, better to prepare for future conflict than get caught by surprise again. If Russia wants to join the liberal world order rather than raging against it, they can themselves make a concerted good faith effort to build trust and to make amends for their past crimes. And slowly things could get better. Or they could choose not to and we can be ready. Seems like a better route there.
