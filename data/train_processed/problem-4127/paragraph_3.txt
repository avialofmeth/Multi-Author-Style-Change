You're actually 100% wrong on this. War is a great place to kill women. War is usually not like Call of Duty where you're engaging the enemy face-to-face, a huge chunk of the time is sitting around doing nothing, and if you're in a city center you can easily kill civilians with little repercussion. Its happened in every single war since time began.
