While primary and secondary school social studies usually doesn't include anything on history of science or mathematics, is it really possible to appreciate civilization without understanding the importance of science and math? If not, is it possible to understand the flow of science and math without learning about and acknowledging the part the Muslim world played from 700-1300 AD? Other than a paragraph or two on Al-Khwarizmi in an elementary algebra textbook, nothing when I was in school. Nothing at all about Ibn Sina and al-Biruni who could lay claim to be the founders of what we call the scientific method.
