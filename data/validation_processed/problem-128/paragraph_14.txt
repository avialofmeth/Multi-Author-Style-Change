Jiang had a unique view of the US. While he believed the American values were incompatible with China, he still respected America. He memorized excerpts from the US Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg Address. He was the last mainland president to go on 60 Minutes. Jiang cared less about ideological purity, and more about understanding the values of other countries. That is what sers him apart from the current general secretary of China.
