Republicans are scared to death of change. They hate it with every fiber of their being because then it means they have to change too. They see conservatism falling apart with every new generation, less religion, more open ideas around sex and love, more acceptance of people who are LBGTQ+, and are out of their minds with fear that they are irrelevant.
