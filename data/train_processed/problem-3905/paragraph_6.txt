This rail accident is relevant to us today, but tomorrow, once it is succeeded by another 20 of them, it will fade from our memory and blur into the distance. The politicians know and are aware of Fatigue that sets in and how it can change over time. They all built their careers off of it. Lest of all Biden was despised and made fun of just a few decades ago for his continued failed presidential runs, shameless plagiarism scandals, and the kind of politics that made him a bit too chummy with hardened white nationalists but decades later we neither have the collective memory nor do we care that much. He's a changed man we're told and we accept that as a fact.
