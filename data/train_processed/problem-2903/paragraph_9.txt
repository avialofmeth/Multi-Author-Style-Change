That was the quid pro quo. Not any more. New hires get far lower benefits. I'm in my agency's tier 4 pension. When I retire my pension will be about 40% less than old timers who retire(d) with tier 1 or 2 pensions. If inflation continues I'm fucked since my pension has no cost of living increases like the old ones did.
