Because there are still a lot of people on Twitter. Also, I really hate the rethoric that Twitter is now an evil place. Some even went as far that Twitter was the recent cause of the mass shooting ( Even before Twitter was live these horrible events took place. Facebook has also been linked to directly caused violence and hate must we all leave that platform as well? Also, I want to add I don't agree that certain people are rehabilitated to go back on Twitter. Only you make it far worse as it is. If you compare Twitter from now to a month almost nothing changed.
