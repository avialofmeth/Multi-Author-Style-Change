> Compared to states where marijuana remained illegal, arrests fell by 76 percent in the four states that did not decriminalize first. That is not surprising, since in those states adults 21 or older who possess less than a specified amount of marijuana are no longer subject to arrest. The other main result is more striking: In states that had already eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana, arrests fell by 40 percent.
