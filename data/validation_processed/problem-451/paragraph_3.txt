"Ukraine is corrupt" has been the main Russian propaganda line for like a decade at this point, and this will do nothing but feed the typical rumors about selling weapons on the black market, or ministers squirreling away funds into offshore accounts. It's important to remember that Ukraine isn't Afghanistan or Iraq - even if some percentage of money and support gets skimmed off, it's not going to be a complete theft like in previous wars.
