Because they can and their self interests are always put over our country. The Republican Party is a joke and they won’t get shit done for this country. All they want is to do investigate the Biden’s and try and stop the cases that will put Trump in jail. Would love for anyone who is Republican to name 1 or 2 bills, written and passed by them that helped the average working American in the last 10 years.
