There isn’t a stage to anything. These are made up theory’s and we can change them any time we want to a system that is better for humanity. We can blend them to fit our societies needs if we have the will. Call it whatever you want but we need to figure out what is best for the common good and stop getting trapped in some invented economic theory from 200 years ago.
