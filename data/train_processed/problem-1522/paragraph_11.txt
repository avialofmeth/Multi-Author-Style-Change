Based on the fact they refused to call out almost all examples and racism/white supremacy I am forced to think that those people make up a significant enough part of their voting block they simply cannot denounce them and win re-election. Obviously not all republicans have those views, but enough Republican voters do, or they would be denouncing this sort of behavior.
