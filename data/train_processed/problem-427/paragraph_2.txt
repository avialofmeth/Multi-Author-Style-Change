you think that there is a parliament. those are incompetent servants of Orban. Dictators like this (and in my country as well, that's how I know) fill their ranks with people who'd never get there without their help, it's the classic Machiavelli. Then they get dictated what to do, and the dictator (see the semantic connection there?) use it as an excuse because the representatives chosen by the people have spoken and he "can't go against people". In reality they can't take a leak without permission and even their wives are not in illusion that those people decide anything.
