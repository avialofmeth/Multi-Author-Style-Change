If there are only 200 votes left to be counted, and if Boebert gets them all, she will have a total of something like 163,937 votes out of 327,131. That is 50.1% of the votes. If Frisch gets no more votes, he will have a total of 163,194 votes. That is 49.88% of the total. A delta of 0.22% (unless I fat fingered my calculator).
