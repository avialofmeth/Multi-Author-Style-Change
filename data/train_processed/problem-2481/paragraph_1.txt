Oh, I understand the confusion. CSTO itself was established in 2002. Until that time there was a treaty called Collective Security Treaty, which was signed in 1992 but took effect for 5 years starting from 1994. When the treaty expired in 1999, Azerbaijan did not renew it, because CST was a symbolic representation of Russian influence upon its members. Azerbaijan together with Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova established GUAM alliance in 1997 in order to counter this influence.
