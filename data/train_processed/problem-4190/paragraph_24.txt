I don't think some of the FL unemployment agents I spoke to even realized they were admitting to comitting federal crimes. They were just following orders handed down from DeSantis. They were very matter of fact talking about being ordered to arbitrarily mark applications as fraudulent and about the fact that no one would ever actially review those claims. They admitted these things as if they were just business as usual.
