So while it isn't inherently considered a genocide by itself, it is a frequent component of one. But the word also changed a lot and can be conflated with genocide anyway if you want(full circle, hope you don't feel you wasted your time reading this shit), making the original commenter technically also correct. Idk. I probably could have left it alone and the point wouldn't have changed. Lol.
