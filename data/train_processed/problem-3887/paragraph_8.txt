These factors above also work the other way around. Romania and Slovakia would be terrible locations to launch counter-attacks from because you would have to chase the enemy through Ukraine. But Estonia and Latvia are within a one week assault range on St Petersburg if the initial attack goes well. In the Black Sea, Turkey actually houses many of the strategic ports and airfields we would need.
