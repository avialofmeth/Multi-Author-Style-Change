If you said just anyone can become a brain surgeon I would never get brain surgery. If you said that just anyone can build a bridge I would not be driving over any bodies of water or canyons anytime soon. If you could become an attorney if you just want it enough I would never pay a dime in attorney's fees. If the only thing it took to become a mechanic was to have pluck and true grit you can stay there and I'll try to figure out what's going on with my car amongst me and my friends.
