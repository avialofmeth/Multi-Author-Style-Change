It's predicted to be some very strange results. In Scotland, Labour are predicted to get back some seats: older snp voters being more against the gender recognition act are switching to labour, while people who voted tory are supposed to be moving to snp. So tory loses seats, snp stays even, Labour gains (I think it's estimated 6 seats).
