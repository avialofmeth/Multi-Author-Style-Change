In the case of Spanish minks reports are fuzzy and inconclusive. Some sources talk of four cages being 'hotspots', with disease radiating outwards from these to nearby cages, implying minks capable of spreading disease. Equally, it's said minks were fed raw fish and poultry by-products, the latter of which may've been contaminated.
