Solar might not be the best option for germany, but it would help if conservative parties like the csu would drop their ridiculous rules like 'the distance from a wind turbine to the nearest settlement needs to be its height times 10'. It's the same people who get drunk on the oktoberfest with people from all over the world, puke everywhere in the city and trains and then oppose cannabis legalization with big publicity because they do not want drug tourism. Thank god these idiots are slowly dying.
