I don't think it's the US looking to find a way to disengage; Biden just asked Congress for another emergency aid package for Ukraine 2 days ago, this time 37 billion. It might have been Ukraine's, zelenskyy has said they wouldn't deny that and would formally apologize, they just haven't seen the data that the US and Poland are looking at (at least at the time of that statement). US could be trying to de-escalate, I don't know, or it could really have been Ukraine's. It wouldn't change the fact that all parties still agree that Russia is ultimately responsible. And even still, it isn't as if Poland is being aggressive and demanding NATO boots on the ground (and neither is Ukraine for that matter). A call for article 5 would need to come from the country attacked, and Poland has only said they want to issue article 4, which is just a discussion involving all parties. I feel like every one here is being reasonable, given what info each party has at hand at any given time so far.
