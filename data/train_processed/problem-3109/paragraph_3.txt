Biden's lawyers found documents, and returned them to NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) as soon as they were discovered. Upon finding the documents, they searched Biden's other properties and returned any additional documents. Robert Huy, special counsel investigating the Biden documents, will confirm (or deny) and his report and recommendations will be made public.
