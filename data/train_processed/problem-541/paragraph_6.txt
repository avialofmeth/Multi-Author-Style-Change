While I would describe them as proud, it's not overly in your face. I haven't been to church in over a decade and while I don't broadcast that (it's not important to me either way but it clearly is to many of them), I also don't find it to be overly cult-y and loud. I haven't been pressed on the fact that I don't join in those discussions.
