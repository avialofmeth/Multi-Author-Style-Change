Not even trying to argue with you. I am not saying it won’t happen, I am saying why it’s stupid to do. After all, invading Ukraine was also a stupid decision and Putin did it anyway. Actually, I have an argument to support your claim. While I believe it’s stupid to invade Taiwan now, I also think there won’t be a better chance for it in the 21st century at least. What I mean is that NATO is distracted by the war in Ukraine, there are a few more conflicts that started or rekindled in 2022 and some ongoing ones that started earlier than that. I strongly believe that after Russia loses this war, there will be a massive change of power balance all over the world. Perfect example, Belarus will kick Lukashenko out on the very same day the war ends. Orban will have less power without Russian support, etc. So if China wants to do this, they should do it before Russia loses this war.
