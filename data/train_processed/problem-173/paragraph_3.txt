It's no joke. I watched my grandfather die from it and... there's not words for what a horrorshow it is. One misfolded prion (protien) and BAM you've got literal holes in your brain. You lose everything that makes you you before you die. Once it starts it's already too late, but even before it starts there's no treatment, it's a death sentence. EDIT Notice I didn't say no CURE there's not even a TREATMENT. You will lose your mind and die in agony, long enough after symptoms start to watch everything you are as a person disappear day by day until you're too far gone to even notice the losing. Even this doesn't adequately capture the horror of dying from a prion disease. And it may be my fate.
