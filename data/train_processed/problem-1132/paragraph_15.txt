Twitter and Apple are not being subjected to laws limiting their ability to say or do things, let alone the fact that they are companies operating on private servers so 1st amendment protections would not apply even if they were being held lawfully responsible for removing content from their servers (which, again, they aren't), regardless of how much fascists whine about being held accountable for their words and actions.
