Sounds like he committed a crime by giving someone's private property to a 3rd party without that person's permission. Giuliani is also an accessory to that crime, and proceeded to continue to send that information onto yet another 3rd party. Fox could be considered as criminally liable as well, considering they were willing to take delivery of said personal property.
