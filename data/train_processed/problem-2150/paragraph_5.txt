I'm Ashkenazi Jewish and we're white as fuck. Nobody in many generations of my ancestors had any connection to Palestine, or any kind of existence near it. Also my extended family was wiped out to about 90% give or take thanks to the Nazis. Know who didn't help them? And who didn't help liberate the concentration camps? Zionist terrorists attacking civilians to form Israel. White men claiming they owned the desert because of religion.
