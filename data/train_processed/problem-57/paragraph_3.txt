Everyone on both sides of this issue seem to be ignoring that the registration part of this new bill directly violates Illinois' FOID Act. The FOID Act explicitly forbids the State Police from creating a registry. I'm curious to see how that will be reconciled in court when it is very clearly stated that the ISP cannot create the list.
