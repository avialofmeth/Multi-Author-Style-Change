Also people have been brainwashed to believe everything the government tells them even when it’s not true. There are some cultural racism there too, the whitewashing and no need to lie and pretend that that doesn’t exist, when there is plenty of data about it. And so is the red light district also a thing. Rape culture although masked still exits there. Am I trying to say that India is a bad place and that they’re bad people? No, that would be the same black and white thinking just like about Muslims.
