I'm not sure we had "absolutely nothing to worry about", the force that "we" would have faced in the 80's is very different to the force the Ukrainians are facing. Unlike the main NATO powers the Russian army is very much a conscription based army with a fraction of the "career" soldiers we have. As Russia couldn't use the conscripts for their "special operation" they are very much hamstrung and lack the manpower they need to effectively use what they have.
