Progressives did excellently this week, and did almost as well in 2020 as they did this week. The election results aren't bearing out this myth that Progressives are "too far left". The Senate seat Democrats gain will be because of a Progressive - Fetterman. Progressive Mandela Barnes also came far closer to winning and being the 52nd Democratic seat than Moderate Val Demmings. Barnes was less than 2% away. With little help from the Party or DSCC compared to Demmings, who lost easily with big party funding.
