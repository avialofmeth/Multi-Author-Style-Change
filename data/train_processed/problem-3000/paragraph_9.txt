Whatever you think of prior administrations, they were nothing like today's extremists. There's always been a type of venom in the gop, a lack of ability to empathize with another human being. This infection I'm talking about really took hold during the Obama administration. I believe their outrage is fed by conservative "entertainment news" media.
