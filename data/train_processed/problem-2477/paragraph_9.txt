I think this is problematic for the simple reason that the men she reported to, for the most part, got to live out their lives, most living openly in West Germany. The real sacks of shit headed to Argentina, Paraguay and/or Brazil, where they also lived out their years in comfort (except for a few notable exceptions, like Eichman). Now that there has been a generational change, there is an attempt to "balance the books" by prosecuting people who were basically juveniles at the time (this defendant was charged and convicted as a juvenile).
