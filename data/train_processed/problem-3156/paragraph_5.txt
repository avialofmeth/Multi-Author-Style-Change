The oil game used to be won by being the last nation with oil. Buy everyone else's, survive their financial peak, then own the market or exploit weaknesses created by the "great drying". Since oil reserves are a finite resource that cannot be replenished, buying other people's oil instead of accessing your own is fucking broken in the long game. Especially when you are literally the US economically.
