That is the issue in the Balkans though. The Balkans have been at war with itself for the last 300 years. The Austrians, Turks, Hungarians and what not have fanned the fires of discontent in order for them to held the regions under their grasp and they well knew the effects. Itâ€™s in the cultural fabric of the countries comprising the region at this point in time and sadly, until the standard of living increases and the painful chapters are discussed and accepted, the status quo will remain.
