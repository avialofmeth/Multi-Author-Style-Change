But the Ukrainian long-range artillery rockets can't reach target areas that are this far away. Instead the West should buy up the cheap Scud/Tochka missiles in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and give to Ukraine. These cheap, old but long-range missiles will be used to saturate Russian air defense so the more precise GLSDB (and one day hopefully the ATACMS) can punch through.
