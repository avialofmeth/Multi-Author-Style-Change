The Kremlin has said these attacks are specifically to give them an upper hand in negotiations. In other words, they know they are leaving, and they want to do as much damage as possible. Which is definitely going to increase the reparations they're going to pay by billions. I am not sure we'll even be able to find any part of Putin's physical body once the oligarchs get to him. Probably there is no window in Russia high enough for him to accidentally fall out of.
