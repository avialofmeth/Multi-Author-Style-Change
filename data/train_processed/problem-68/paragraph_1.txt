Live in Portland Oregon. Complete shithole and steadily getting worse. Kate brown had the lowest approval rating in the entire country, with homelessness skyrocketing as well as crime, poverty, housing costs, taxes, etc… and everyone just cheers that “at least she isn’t a republican”. I watch everyone accusing each other part of the same exact things calling them depraved fascists then saying how they should be silenced??? State and country is going bat shit. Too bad Betsy didn’t take it, stuck with Tina kotek who will hopefully be better for Oregon but I personally highly doubt it. Anyway go democrats Or go republicans Fucked either way until people start voting based off the candidate and not just their favorite sports team, I mean political party. Smh.
