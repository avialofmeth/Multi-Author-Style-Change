Do you know for sure whether those sensors would be on sanctions lists? This was something I was wondering about a while back, because I used to work in manufacturing, and without the controllers that have computer chips in them, the equipment I used to run, wouldn't even work. I had to replace them somewhat regularly. Same with the sensors.
