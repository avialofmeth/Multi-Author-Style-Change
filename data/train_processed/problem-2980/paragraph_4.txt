I meant that tensions are higher than normal. There hasn't been a peep out any splinter of the IRA in a long time, the UVF have been pretty visible on the last year with threats and a couple of attempts supposedly halted at the last minute (source is the letter to the PSNI from the UVF last month, apparently an olive branch not to go through with it).
