## Overview
This project is the final exam assignment of the course Language Processing 2 at the University of Copenhagen. In this code, we employed three approaches: Prompt engineering, BERT and TF-IDF (Baseline).


## Dataset
The PAN 24 Style Change Detection dataset can be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/records/10677876. Run `preprocess.ipynb` to preprocess the data.

## Usage
### Prompt Engineering
Run `prompting.ipynb` to get LLM generated responses; Run `process_json.ipynb` to deal with some responses with incorrect format; Run `evaluation.ipynb` to get evaluation results.
