I have a theory that they’ve learned what trump does when he’s cornered, so instead of starting the game with all the cards such that Trump’s legal team can explore obscure meanings through multiple lawsuits for the rest of his life, DoJ is systematically stacking the deck. They are also getting all their ducks in a row—really trying to do everything ahead of time that can be done before he is formally charged. Specifically, I mean eliminating as many avenues of legal challenge Trump would use as possible. It’s clearly a massive undertaking difficult to visualize. Good things take diligence and time. Of course, this is just my poorly-articulated theory, nothing more.
