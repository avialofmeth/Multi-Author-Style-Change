And to the nationalists out there (those who are not ♻️ eco-nationalists 🏳️): I get that you care about your country and your sovereignty, and I get the international cooperation can harm that sovereignty, but climate change can and will affect the entire world, including your country. And if you really cared about your country’s future and wellbeing, then you’d do everything to not only protect, and even restore the natural beauty of your nation, but you would also help other countries do the same thing.
