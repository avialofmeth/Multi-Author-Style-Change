I think I'd get behind announcing retroactive 0% and no forgiveness. It might shut up the "you took out your loan, now pay it back" people and would help way, WAY more people than $10K/$20K forgiveness will. It would be easy easier to argue that people should pay back what they borrowed but that the government shouldn't be in the business of profiting off of student loans. Making it retroactive would in effect likely mean lots of people get refund checks. Most people I know who still have student loan debt 10, 15 years later have way more than paid off their initial principal balance already. It's the interest that keeps us in chains.
