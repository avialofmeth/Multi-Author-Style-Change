Idk what much more the Dems could have done to win in 2010. They lost because voters thought they did way too much, and thus a lot of those ancestral blue dog voters who thought Obama would be bipartisan like Clinton and got pissed when he actually did a massive liberal expansion of healthcare, a big government stimulus, expansion of college subsidies for low income students, and a major regulation on the financial industry.
