Someone (apparently) accidentally launched a Russian-made missile that hit a farm in Poland and killed 2 people. Poland wants to declare Article 4 earlier but dropped it; leaders meet nonetheless to talk about the situation and where did that came from. Redditors are pointing at Russia, the ones that got downvoted to oblivion are pointing it at Ukraine, it's a shit show tbh.
