Kind of an interesting economic, political, and moral dilemma. Let the slave owners keep their plantations and all their infrastructure to keep the transition as quick and smooth as possible? Should the government seize everything and take over production (basically transition to communism)? Let the entire industries fail until new private businesses are established (truly free market)? The latter two options potentially cause mass shortages and famine for an unknown time period.
