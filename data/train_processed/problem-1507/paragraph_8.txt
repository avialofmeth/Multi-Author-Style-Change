I mean, Trump is probably the most obvious example. He became a Republican as easily as someone changes hats. He switched his opinion on a few key partisan issues, and he became the king of the GOP overnight. It was disgustingly blatant that he didn't give a fuck about any of the GOP's stances, but he repeated his slogans often enough that people forgot who he was.
