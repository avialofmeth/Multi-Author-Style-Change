Plus, where is Russia going to get equipment to outfit these extra 500k soldiers? Their current army isn't properly equipped. It's crazy how far they are willing to take this farce. Every step they take makes them a bigger pariah on an international scale. The West is less and less willing to work with them, while the East takes bigger advantage of their poor standing for personal gain. All of which makes Russia weaker and weaker.
