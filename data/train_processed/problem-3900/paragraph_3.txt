Pretty intense comment there, friend. I would discourage you from tarring an entire country of 143 million people with the same brush as you would their leadership. And I would encourage you to look beyond the headlines of “Russia does this” and “Russia does that” to see that it is the leadership doing “this” and “that” rather than the entire country as a whole.
