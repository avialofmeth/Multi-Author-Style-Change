It’s counterintuitive but I like what he’s doing. First it’s going to be a consistent product, that won’t have you accidentally overdosing are a stronger than expected batch. Second, the product won’t be cut with stuff like baking soda and other things that will probably kill your eventually. Third, with accessibility and access to knowledge of what each drug does having some weed next to coke next to meth and then next to krocodile. People will probably rethink going for the harder thing since there is accessibility, and they aren’t just grabbing something harder because they need a fix and the harder thing is all they can get a hold of. This is how people go from pain killers after a surgery to the hard stuff. Fourth, removing the stigma of these drugs helps give people a chance to get help and to sober up, and also access safe drugs to wean them off so they don’t die going cold turkey. It’s about helping people get healthy and out of the addiction rather than enabling people.
