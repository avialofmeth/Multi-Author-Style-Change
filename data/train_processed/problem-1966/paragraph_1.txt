This would seem to suggest there is some uneasiness among Russian citizens about the war in Ukraine. We have been hearing that the war against Ukraine enjoys much support by Russians but there seems to be a segment of Russians who at least understand that their armies are committing atrocities. Am I correct or have I missed something?
