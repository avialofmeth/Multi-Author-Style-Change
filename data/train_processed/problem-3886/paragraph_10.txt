2) We will need the energy though, most of our exports are currently gas, not oil. And last time I checked Germany and large parts of Europe is quite dependent on it. After all, we do live in a period of energy crisis. Besides gas, oil is still and will continue to be important (possibly less so over the years) well into the future. Think about everything oil is used for, from medicines to electronics. An EV, although powered by electricity, is full of components made by products made from oil.
