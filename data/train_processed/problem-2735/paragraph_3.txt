Sounds like to me there are investigations being done, just not public ones. IMO there is a very clear reason the conservatives are asking for a public inquiry, they know theres no chance in hell highly classified CSIS documents related to chinese intelligence are going to be declassified. They want soundbites and outrage to feed their base, not accountability. How republican of them.
