There are quite a few instances, where huge sums are being offered where it doesn't make sense. Twitter being the most recent example. I don't personally feel that the offer for Acti/Blizz falls in that category though. MS probably could get a better deal if they were willing to wait for it and apply pressure over a longer term. But, as I said, the goal here for MS is way beyond just the revenue stream, and waiting to save some money would work against their long term goals.
