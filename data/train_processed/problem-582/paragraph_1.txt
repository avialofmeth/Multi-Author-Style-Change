If someone gets out of their car on the motorway in order to drag away a couple of blockaders, the traffic has already stopped, so there is no danger. Unless some bloodthirsty psychopath in the first row of cars decides to drive over the protesters of course. You would think that's unlikely, but judging from the number of times this has happened, it seems like a significant percentage of car drivers are bloodthirsty psychopaths.
