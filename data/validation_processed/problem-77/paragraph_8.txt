There are no easy answer, like I said above. I don't know if just throwing money at them and letting them keep screwing over their own people really is the answer though. There's real suffering going on while rich people do rich people things. Like I said, there are large examples across canada of nations really doing it right. But there are some that break my heart when I hear what's happening because it's not for lack of resources, I assure you.
