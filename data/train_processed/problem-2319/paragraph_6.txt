Wonder how they didnâ€™t? They paid pensions, allowed humanitarian access, done withdrawal of heavy weapons (which was also done under control of OSCE), done prisoners exchanges, approved laws demanded in minsk agreements, done amnesty for separatist participating in previous events, demanded constitutional reform was approved as well, except Ukraine still was forced to retaliate at peroodical separatists fire, and never get access: to border control, taxes collected on occupied territories, participating in elections, ah yep and and no acess to banks vaults so not really regaining control on banking sector.
