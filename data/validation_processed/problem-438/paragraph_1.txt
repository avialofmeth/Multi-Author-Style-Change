That has happened in the past in state legislatures. A few years back the NY legislature had a similar situation, deadlocked and didn’t have enough people for a quorum to vote, as republicans were staying out of the room because they didn’t want the Democratic majority to take control, but one Republican legislator walked into the chamber to get to the vending machine on the other end, and a Democrat quickly called for a floor vote and it passed, flipping the legislature blue again. The Republican insisted he shouldn’t count as present but it was too late.
