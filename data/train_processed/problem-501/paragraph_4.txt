Yep, and as it stands now they don't seem to have a desire to address this problem than letting the virus more or less move through the population. Letting it kill scores of people and leaving anyone strong enough to survive. Worst yet, they are actively trying to spread the virus by making it easier to travel for Chinese citizens outside the country who are likely infected with it. They do not care about their citizens' health or wellbeing the same way they don't care about the health of wellbeing of any other country's citizens.
