Like I hated Schrader too, but the district was a highly competitive one, and even strong incumbents have been struggling in a lot of places. It wasn't an unreasonable decision to prioritize other races they thought they had a better chance in, especially when money doesn't translate directly into votes. It's not like we can say "If they'd spent X million, she WOULD have won" - all we can say is "Maybe she would have, maybe they'd have wasted a ton of money that did more good elsewhere.".
