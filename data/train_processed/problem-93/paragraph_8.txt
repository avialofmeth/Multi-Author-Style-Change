This war is unfortunately not over yet either. Russia still is dangerous and we might meme about it all day long but it doesn't change a fact hundreds of people die every day, potentially hundreds of thousands were forcefully moved inside Russia and millions are left without hot water and electricity. It's not over yet and Ukraine still needs shitton of support to defend itself.
