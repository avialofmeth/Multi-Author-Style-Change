The difference is that competing under the country's flag has an implicit support of the country. That's why the US has had athletes on its national team speaking up or abstaining over police violence. Most of these competitions still allow the athletes to compete under a neutral/world flag. But allowing them to compete under the Russian flag at a time people are committing unspeakable atrocities under it, it's inappropriate.
