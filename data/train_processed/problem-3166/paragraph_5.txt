This sub loves to hate on Joe Manchin but you better hope to whatever deity you prefer that he wins. You currently have a Democratic senator from one of the reddest states in the country and you may never have another in your lifetime if he goes down right now. Like him or not he has been helpful in passing some key Biden legislation and seating more judges than any President to this point. You don't have to like him but do you really want to lose him?
