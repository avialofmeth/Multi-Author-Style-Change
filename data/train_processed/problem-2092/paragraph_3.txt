At the end, I would have absolutely loved to have seen a full-blown double-barreled blue chambers with so many Democrats that it'd make Newt cry even harder on Twitter or Fox or OANN or whatever the Hell he uses, but if we could eventually find a way to flip this fundamentalist behavior on its head, then that'll take a major boon off. Keyword being "if", because they are employing Stalinist-levels of truth manipulation to try to keep themselves relevant.
