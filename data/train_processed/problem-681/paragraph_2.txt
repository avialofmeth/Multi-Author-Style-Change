I still think my analogy is more appropriate than the nightclub one, because the developers probably did have an intent to cause addiction. They designed WoW in a way that they knew everyone is vulnerable to become addicted to. They had an obvious motive to get as many people as possible addicted, ideally everyone. This not like a nightclub owner who has no intent to harm a photosensitive person, and gains nothing from doing so.
