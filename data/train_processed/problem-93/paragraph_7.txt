And finally problem 4 - Russia believed it's much more powerful than it is. In fact this war shocked the world because it made so little sense on paper. Apparently FSB agents assigned the task of figuring out if it's even possible and what repercussions would be thought it's a usual thought exercise. And in Russia "usual" would mean that you want to prove your country is the best in the world and rotten west can't do jackshit. So plans prepared for invasion made no sense. It still was... closer than we think it was however, these first days of the war with airport being taken over, assassins sent to Kiev to kill Zelensky and so on probably had very serious chances of killing the government officials and maybe even seizing the capital.
