It says a lot about you that you think all immigrants go to the fields or whatever exploitable labor that you're thinking of. You realize that most engineering, medicine, and other high level roles need legal-immigrants from other countries and they are still understaffed? I say that as someone who has quite a lot of personal experience on that subject.
