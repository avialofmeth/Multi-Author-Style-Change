Biden can actually do this. Yes, he is old. But he's an incumbent who has proven he can deal with Joe Manchins to get legislation passed. He has proven that he can win elections (he pulled off two historic feats, unseating an incumbent president, and then NOT losing many seats in the midterms). And he has proven that he can create jobs, (and to some extent help with the inflation). He has proven that he can he tough on Russia.
