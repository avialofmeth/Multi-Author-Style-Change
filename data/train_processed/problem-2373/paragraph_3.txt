Vehicle in the front gets taken out by a mine. Second vehicle in line tries to drive around it and immediately gets taken out by another mine. Third vehicle tries driving around the other side of the first vehicle and, miraculously, isn't immediately blown up -- then thinks better of it and decides to back up... directly into another mine.
