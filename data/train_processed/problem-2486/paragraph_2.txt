Except by the time that happens, the young folks have now become the old folks. And they end up with all the same vested interests all the same property turf, power, wealth, etc. Russia has completely backslid. Many countries are backsliding and not progressing forward. And autocracies are now learning how to leverage technology to create an even tighter digital iron fist. Protests and revolutions will become harder because it will be more difficult to not be surveilled and protests preempted and worst is it becomes so much easier to identify protesters after they protest. And arrest them later and go after their families.
