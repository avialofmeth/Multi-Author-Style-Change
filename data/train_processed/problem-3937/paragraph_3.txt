Haha that’s true, but it’s important for people to realize that there was a huge right-wing fear-mongering campaign against the Workers Rights Amendment. Conservative groups funded by the ultrawealthy were screaming about how passing this amendment would raise taxes and make Illinois one of the unfriendliest states for business. They defeated an amendment in 2020 that would replace Illinois’s flat income tax with a progressive one.
