Umm, are we watching the same war? Russia is getting pushed back on every front except the meat grinder which is Bakhmut. Ukraine liberated 400+ settlements in the past 3 months and Russia claimed 3. Russia is burning through equipment at an unsustainable rate and is having to buy extra stuff off of Iran and North Korea. Russian support for the war is lower than Ukrainian support for it. Russia failed to win in a surprise attack with their best troops and now has lost over 50% of the land that they held at their peak and are desperately throwing conscripts into the line to try to accomplish anything since last July.
