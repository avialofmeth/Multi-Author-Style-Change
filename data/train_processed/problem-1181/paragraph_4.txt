The issue is not Germany providing tanks, they are preventing others from doing so. Other countries (Poland, Spain, and others) have agreed to transfer their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Problem is because there's an export control agreement with Germany, Germany has to give permission to the other countries to transfer their tanks.
