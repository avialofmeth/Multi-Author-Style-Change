One third of Arizona voters are Independents, Ruben Gallego has Arizonas 3rd congressional district, which is basically just the city of Phoenix. His politics dont align with the rest of the state which are primarily conservative, Voters are not going to elect him. He would be a bad candidate to put up against Sinema.
