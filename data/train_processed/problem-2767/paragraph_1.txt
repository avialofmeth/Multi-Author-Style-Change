Yep, it’s super frustrating the monopoly they’ve built. That being said, with a little actual work, they could’ve planned a tour that doesn’t hit TM venues, it IS possible. But the TM ecosystem makes it so easy/simple that they go the easy route, not to mention TSwift and Co stand to make the most $$$ by having this circus occur. Any press is good press, now this tour is even more hyped up.
