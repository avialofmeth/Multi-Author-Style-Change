I’ve said it many times…Reddit is one of the most ageist social media sites out there. Towards old and young. It’s disgusting. I personally know many seniors who are/were kind, smart people who have done their best to make the world a better place. I also know lots of little humans who are developing and growing, and just trying to make sense of the world around them. So many assholes around here.
