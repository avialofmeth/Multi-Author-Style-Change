But now the chants of defund the police - it's really extremism. The latinx comments show how out of touch and different the dems are from the Latino community. As an Asian myself, the word bipoc drives me nuts as both asians and Hispanics have been erased from the word for minorities. Hollywood now elevates black people but Hispanics and asians are still underrepresented according to the Hollywood diversity report and quite clear in most tv shows and movies where you now see many blacks but still barely any hispanics/asians.
