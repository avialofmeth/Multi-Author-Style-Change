That said with the way money goes through politics, there can be some strange bedfellows in politics…to go further than the original saying. I’m not convinced even in Los Angeles we’ve seen the last of, for instance, the councilmembers caught on tape, though 2 of the 3 are out of official office (1 resigned, the other had lost anyways before said tape was an issue).
