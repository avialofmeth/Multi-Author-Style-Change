I fully agree with everything you said. I work for a company that has lots of cool perks and is definitely a millennial/gen z vibe, but we work really hard and give great output. The idea is we want to attract and keep the best people. Good people can jump from job to job for a higher salary, but we have a vibe that makes people want to stay.
