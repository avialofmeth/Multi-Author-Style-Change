I mean there's a few contenders. I think Nikolai Patrushev has been floated as a likely successor if Putin dies soon. He's very close to Putin and was also former KGB. He was the head of the FSB and is now secretary of the Security Council, and is perhaps even more extreme than Putin when it comes to geopolitics. He's two years older than Putin but he has a son who's being groomed for power.
