Ill raise you one, we (Australia) had a program called REDcycle where people could drop off soft plastics to be recycled at major supermarkets. Turns out it was just being stockpiled in warehouses creating a fire hazard so the EPA has directed them to dump all 5200 tonnes of soft plastic into landfill.
