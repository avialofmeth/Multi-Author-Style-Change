Funny you're oblivious to democracy being under attack around the world. It's already happened in Europe - see Hungary. The US just saw an attempt to overthrow the Constitution. Democracy in Brazil has been under constant attack. None were by left leaning people. Does it happen? Of course. It's just far more likely and is happening with right leaning people.
