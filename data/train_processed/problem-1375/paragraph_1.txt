The last 2 days were pretty quiet, there were no missile strikes, but as usual the towns that are close to the border get shelled every day. I don’t think there were even any reports of Kupiansk getting shelled these past 2 days, but it still could have been shelled, just not reported, there aren’t that many people living there nowadays after all. Though there were also no missile launches from Belgorod, so if it was shelled, then it was done by regular artillery and not missiles.
