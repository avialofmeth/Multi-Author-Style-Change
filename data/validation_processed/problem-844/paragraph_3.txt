it's all gentrifying everywhere in Colorado now though, even the rough around the edges kinda shitty towns are seeing a lot of growth and development. A lot more people moving to Colorado in general and a lot of this people would rather just live near the mountains anyway as they get priced out of the front range and mountain towns.
