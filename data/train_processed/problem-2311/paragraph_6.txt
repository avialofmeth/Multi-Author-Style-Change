Whether they’re urban or rural, they each have one vote. The point in Texas is that educated white collar workers are moving from other (usually Democratic) states to work in finance & tech. On the other hand, much of Texas’ rural population is old and dying out. I honestly think Texas will be purple in 8-10 years.
