I wasn’t referencing war crimes, I was originally referring to “legal” war. However, the definition of legal war and rules of engagement change often and sometimes contradicts. Sherman never committed war crimes because there was no rule of war proscribing him from those actions. He was brutal but effective, in what we will in modernity consider atrocities, to gain his objectives and prosecute his war against the rebels. So when we denounce atrocities, what’s the rubric for the definition of an atrocity, and can it be an atrocity if legal by agreed rules of conflict?
