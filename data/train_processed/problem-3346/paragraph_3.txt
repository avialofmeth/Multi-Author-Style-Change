Unfortunately we don't know that. Putin is getting stories and reports heavily filtered by his lieutenants. He is no longer making most of strategic level decisions and almost none of tactical. He can be dead for all we know and it can be one of his body double that we see. Like that drive on the Crimea bridge - most probably it wasn't him. The driver was less puffy than Putin on TV a few hours later.
