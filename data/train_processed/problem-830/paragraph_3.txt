You're forgetting that just running in a close or heavily watched race is better marketing than you could probably even pay for. Some thought that was the 2016 Trump campaign's real goal, just notoriety and narcissistic name pumping which is especially good when your name is your brand, which is true in both cases here. Especially with money so wrapped up in campaign finance, you can make a ton of money if you already have a brand and milk supporters to cover costs.
