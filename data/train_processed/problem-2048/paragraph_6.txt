Many louisiana prisoners turn a big profit because they can be forced to work and paid less than a dollar an hour for it. Its pretty fucked, and in a similarly fucked way the profits are likely going to private prison owners (who we already pay 10s of thousands year per prisone) and the companies that buy the slave labor (who are probably buddies of the state officials that set up the contracts).
