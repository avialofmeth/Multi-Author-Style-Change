So the next step should be to address the college prices. Though the government canâ€™t force a college only charge whatever price, but they can influence prices. The easiest way I can think of to do this and at least try to be reasonable with the Republicans would be to essentially calculate what payments would be under the new IDR plan with average salaries after graduating for the major.
