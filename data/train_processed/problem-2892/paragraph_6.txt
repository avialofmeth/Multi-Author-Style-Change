If your goal is to get from A to B quickly by car in a dense city, you have the wrong goals. That's geometrically impossible, because if getting around by cars is fast, everybody uses a car, which makes it slow again. Car trips should be possible (for the few people who need to use a car/truck for a specific reason), but it shouldn't be the fastest way to get around, and cars should have to make detours around neighborhoods while pedestrians, cyclists, and transit go the direct route. That's the only way to reduce car congestion.
