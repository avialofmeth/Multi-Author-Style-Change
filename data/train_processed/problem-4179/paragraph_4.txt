Culture wars are not a reason to dumb down education- we are already way behind other countries in how effective and educated our kids are. Diversity and inclusion are not woke concepts,they are human concepts. Education is the biggest gift we can give children, and not telling all of it, and only telling the parts you like or agree with, does no one any favors.
