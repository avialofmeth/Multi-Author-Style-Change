Bananas are an excellent example of why genetic monoculture farming is problematic over the long term. First the gros michel banana dominated, but a blight hit it and wiped out the world's gros michels. Then the cavendish banana took its place, but a blight hit it and wiped out the Old World's cavendish bananas, and now that blight has crossed the Atlantic.
