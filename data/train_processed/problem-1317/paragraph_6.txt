Worked in a call center around a decade ago for 2 years, It was awful. We had had only a certain amount of "personal time" each day, which I think was like 8 mins. We were dinged if it was taking to long to help a customer and if didnt even matter what the issue is. And don't even get me started on the abuse we took for corp.
