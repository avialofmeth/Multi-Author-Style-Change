So is it possible that a "rogue" officer in the PLA implemented this spy balloon program without the knowledge of Xi or anyone on the CMC? Sure, it's possible. But I'm leaning more towards plausible deniability. Xi was probably aware of the spy balloons, and knew that one would make it over the US. He just kept his distance.
