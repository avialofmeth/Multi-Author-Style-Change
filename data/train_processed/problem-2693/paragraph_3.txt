He’s not one of the wealthy or privileged people though… but he is thinking very apathetically, like black and white thinking. The texts could explain better than I am capable of. …. He thinks that just because I’m trying to explain to him that you shouldn’t hate a nation for their religion or something but an individual instead and he thinks that I’m supporting the criminals due to that and that if I’m just anti Indian I could just say so lol, which I’m not. I’m not dumb or brainwashed to hate for example the Russian diaspora that lives in my country just because they’re Russian descent. I know that though there are a lot of criminal Romani people in my country I don’t think that they all are criminals and should be genocided or terrorised due to that. But I guess he and many Indians think that way. Which is awful and unfair and it only brings suffering to this world. Such thinking is biased and very one sided and dangerous.
