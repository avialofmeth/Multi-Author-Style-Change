What really surprises me is the double standards as well. For instance, in my family the boys were encouraged to date or marry other Thai women, but my sisters were all encouraged to only date white guys and to stay away from Thai men. Personally I'm not all that attracted to Asian women. They remind me of my mother, whom I don't get along with. So she and I have never really seen eye to eye in my dating history.
