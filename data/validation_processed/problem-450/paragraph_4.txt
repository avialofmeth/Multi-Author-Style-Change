Sure, it is extremely difficult to get permits, but it is everywhere so. You need to own the land. You need to be able to prove ownership. You need to pay taxes on it. You even need to conform to some rules (sometimes, the structure color is defined for you, sometimes even the vegetation in your garden is regulated!), submit plans, wait, resubmit etc etc...
