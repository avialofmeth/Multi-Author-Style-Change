The government does not prohibit anyone's ability to worship as they believe with a few notable exceptions. However, it has an absolute interest in protecting the right of a citizens to be able to participate in society equally. If your religion tells you homosexuality is immoral and sinful, you are free to believe that. You should not be able to use that belief to deny others their ability to access government services, get married, and enjoy legal protection against discrimination.
