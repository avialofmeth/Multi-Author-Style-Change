Yes and also if doing pour over for grinds, if you make it thick it (edit: this it being the appropriate temp range instead of boiling temp) also lets you still get more cups out of it since you donâ€™t overextract and breakdown flavor in the first or first few pour throughs - still need to do them immediately though.
