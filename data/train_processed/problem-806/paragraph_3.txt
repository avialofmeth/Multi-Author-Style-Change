Federal judges should absolutely know the US Constitution well, even if all sections aren't completely relevant to their rulings. But asking generic questions like "Tell me about article V" is a bad question, intentionally asked to fluster someone in a high stakes situation. I don't expect anyone to need to know the numbering of sections of the Constitution. That's more like an English teacher asking "Tell me about paragraph 9".
