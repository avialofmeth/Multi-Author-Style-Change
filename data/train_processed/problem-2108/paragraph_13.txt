But I put heavy emphasis on The Summery of the Law in which Jesus answered the question of which is the most important law. Greatly condensed, it was to love God and to love one's fellow human beings. He gave the parable of The Good Samaritan to expand the definition of "neighbor" and state what He meant by "love". Actually, He was quoting from the OT.
