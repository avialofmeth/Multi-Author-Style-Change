I'm not sure why you're being downvoted it's a good question. The sore loser laws only apply to presidential candidates in a few states. Most of them are states that he wasn't going to win regardless. The two that do matter are Michigan and West Virginia. If he loses big on Super Tuesday he can withdraw from the Republican primary and not trigger the law in West Virginia. In Michigan, he can run a campaign as a write-in candidate.
