Well no, that's why we keep building them out. And they also can't replace oil, since they produce electricity and most oil goes to transport. Nuclear plants, even SMRs, also can't replace the oil used in transport. Meaning, the bulk of oil being used around the world. But I'd disagree with the notion that renewables aren't yet displacing fossil fuels. They just aren't displacing all fossil fuels. The world is already getting a higher percentage of primary energy from renewables than it ever has from nuclear.
