I don’t agree that 15 and 16 should have legally protected online privacy rights. I find that assertion absurd. I don’t agree that age verification is a unspeakable wrong, and I find the idea that this would somehow make us not anonymous online laughable. Apps are spyware. They tell whoever it is that they report to where you live and where you go. That alone is enough to identify you, but they don’t stop there. They tell them everything you search and what you buy. They have a more precise and accurate picture of me than I do of myself. They do all of this to find more effective means of predicting and altering your decisions. Social media takes this even further. Yet I’m to believe that age verification is a bridge too far? It seems the line is drawn ONLY where it might actually limit access to minors.
