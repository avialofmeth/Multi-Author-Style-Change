These protests are going to have to change power on their own and lots of Iranian people are probably going to lose their lives going against their corrupt and backwards government. I don't want to see another Arab spring intervention which cripples Iran as a country and drives it into civil war, I just want to see their damn regime replaced and 50% of their population finally be seen as equals.
