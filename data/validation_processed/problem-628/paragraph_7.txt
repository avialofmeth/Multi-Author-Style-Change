the fact that DeSantis won by almost 20 points while running a campaign rich in bigotry and full of promises that he will work to make sure the right people die(trans kids, PoC, the unvaxxed) should be a horrific wake up call. The state is more or less a 50/50 purple state according to polling, the Democratic party might want to try to craft a policy message that actually lands with the the average voters in FL. as crazy as that sounds it just might work.
