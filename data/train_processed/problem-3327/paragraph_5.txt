I've actually learnt to love that phrase. There isn't a British idiom that quite captures the essence of "do the needful": that implication that it's widely known what needs to be done, it's slightly too complicated to spell out precisely what it is, but there's an implicit assumption that you will shout out if you don't know what you are meant to be doing.
