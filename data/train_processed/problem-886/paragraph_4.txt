: Please make sure that you allow at least 10 minutes to pass between each submission, and submit no more than 5 articles within a 24 hour period. This is so that other Redditors have the opportunity to submit content and have it visible to /r/politics users. Deleted posts are included in this rule. Moderator removed posts are not. Queue flooding will result in moderator action against offending accounts.
