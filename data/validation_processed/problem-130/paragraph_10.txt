Nice question, the quick answer is you go into the interview with your facts ready as much as possible! This has always been an issue for most reporters covering all sorts of topics. The best way I’ve learned to combat it is to re-ask questions, point out the facts and sometimes ask them to share where the info that doesn’t seem quite right is coming from. I think most political reporters (especially those of us on-air) are aware that spin almost always happens, so be ready.
