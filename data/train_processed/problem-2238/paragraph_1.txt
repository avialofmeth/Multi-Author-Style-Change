Not really. Borders have been open for quite a while and so has the requirement for pre departure testing for all countries. The travellers coming from the northern hemisphere winter have not caused any sort of bump. Once Omicron got in the tactic changed and it would be illogical to not treat it as endemic now and to change anything. Should some new varient pop up that poses an existential threat then I'm sure they would revisit things but that is not the case.
