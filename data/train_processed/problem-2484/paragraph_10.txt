\-- Fair Use may not help either -- if Woodward published substantially ALL of the tapes, instead of selections for the purposes of commentary. Lotta public interest here (I'm glad the tapes were disclosed) but that probably doesn't justify Woodward making a buck by selling the tapes as an audiobook (if that's what he did).
