The US is the only player that has little-to-no economic or political relationship with Azerbaijan (compared to the EU and Russia). They have the power to stop this but this can change depending on the next administration. The Biden administration (and his State Department) has been the most proactive in recent history regarding this issue. The US (under Biden) has been willing to call out Azerbaijan for numerous violations and even helped stop the September 2022 Azeri invasion into Armenia proper. Nancy Pelosi even visited Armenia back in September and met with the PM and other high-ranking officials in the country. However this can drastically change if a different administration takes over in 2 years; especially a Trump administration, who not only has business ties with both (as exposed in his tax returns) Turkey and Azerbaijan, but also holds an isolationist "America first" policy.
