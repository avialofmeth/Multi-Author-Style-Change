The case relates to a carnival performance by a yodel choir in November 2022, in which choir head Markus Nef caused controversy by stepping onto the stage with a black painted face, frizzy wig, drum and grass skirt. Nef, a local farmer, denied allegations of racism, saying he had no time for that in a place where people “work and don’t look for trouble”. He said he had never heard the term “blackfacing” before.
