I just hope that as we get better data we can converge a little more on what works and what doesn't rather than retreating to pure ideological or identity based reasoning. Reality is complicated and messy. Simple, elegant solutions never work no matter how much I, personally, wish that we could fix everything by simply converting to a Negative Income Tax and roll capital gains into this new income tax while putting in place a nationwide Land Value Tax to further punish absentee landowners. I recognize that such a plan would solve one set of problems while creating a completely separate set.
