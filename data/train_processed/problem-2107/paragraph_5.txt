But it can do that on a gender neutral basis and focus on needs-based. These carve outs for this group or that group not only serve to divide ("Hey, how came "they" get that and I don't?!?" is likely a common response), but also makes the left look loony to many voters out there who Dems could otherwise win over if not associated with these programs. As a lifelong liberal and Dem voter, I disapprove of this program and these approaches.
