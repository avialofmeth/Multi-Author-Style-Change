My argument here is if Intel shows russia will seriously launch nukes everywhere if we get directly involved in any fashion. Basically tell them to respect our 1st strike doctrine at that point, since they already launched one in a war of aggression without cause, if Intel networks said russia will launch a their nukes world wide it would have to be done.
