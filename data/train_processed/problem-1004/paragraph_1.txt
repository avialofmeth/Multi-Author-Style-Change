That's what I mean. The pattern is ironic. It's totally misleading that they call themselves "the truth" and keep calling themselves that after the most famous Russian propaganda paper also called themselves that for decades when everyone knew it was all literal fake news. It's kind of like how Fox News will attach the "News" label to it's many opinion/infotainment shows to try to add legitimacy to the shows and then never back that up or claim it is clearly NOT news when they are questioned in court or when it actually could lead to consequences (except way worse since it's state sponsored propaganda).
