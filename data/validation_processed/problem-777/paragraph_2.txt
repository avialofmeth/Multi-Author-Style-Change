Don't think this will be another war... at first I thought Israel was invading Jordan but it seems like they want to annex part of the West Bank thats called the Jordan Valley, not actual Jordan. From the bit of research I just did it seems like Israel already controls this eastern part of the West Bank with mostly jews living there with the exception of Jericho and Al-Auja. So pretty much they wanna turn their unofficial control into official control by claiming it as Israel proper. It'll be condemned by world leaders but I don't think it'll start a war since Palestinians don't have an army and Jordan isn't being invaded.
