I mean purely to snub Russia we would've helped them some regardless assuming we didnt think they would just lose all of the equipment into Russian hands. However seeing Russia acting aggressive, someone we already consider a threat, but also being held back by Ukraine the West is feeling more and more confident giving them bigger toys to play with. They dont see it as likely for them to lose them to the Russians, they get to see how well those Toys work on Russian equipment, and they get to watch their enemy get beat up for some pocket change.
