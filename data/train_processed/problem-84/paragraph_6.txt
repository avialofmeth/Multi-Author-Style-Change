Orbán also said that he believed that the time had long passed when Russia would have been able to conquer Ukraine and install a pro-Russian government in the country. "If Russia had won a quick victory, this might have been possible, but now it is hopeless." Therefore, Orbán said, Russia's goal is to turn Ukraine into an ungovernable wreck so that the West has no claim on it. They have already succeeded, he said, and Ukraine is now like Afghanistan, "a no-man's land". But Russia cannot allow NATO to enter Ukraine.
