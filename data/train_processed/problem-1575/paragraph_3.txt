I'm vaguely reminded of when, during the 2020 election, Republican operatives leaked a recording of a phone call between Joe and Hunter from when Hunter was in rehab. And what was in the call? Joe telling Hunter that he loved him, and no matter what happened he would always be his son, and would be there for him.
