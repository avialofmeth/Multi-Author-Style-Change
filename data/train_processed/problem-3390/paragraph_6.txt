They would lose all control, at least right now they're not shelling entire neighbourhoods from existence like Bashar did in Syria. Hard as it is, the best solution is a political one, not that I see the mullahs wanting to see out their remaining days in exile in Russia... Still, it's very clear that they are despised by a good majority of their own people and that leaves them unable to claim legitimacy in governance.
