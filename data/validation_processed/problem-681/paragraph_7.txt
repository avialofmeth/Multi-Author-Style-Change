This isn't possible. Churches, especially in the South where I'm familiar with, are nothing more than mandatory right-wing community meetings with Christian window dressing. One time I attended a church in Pascagoula, MS with a former friend and I kid you not it was like watching a 1hr speech prepared by Fox News opinion writers where they spoke out against immigrants, atheists, and the evil Democrats. I went to several churches with this person (they were in the choir) and it was the same every time.
