What's happening here in France is basically an immigration issue: people illegally cross borders into France, and end up in poor conditions, having to take jobs wherever they can, "under the table". France does not condone this, and is both actively checking worksites to combat this practice, and even the unions want these people to be regularized and paid proper wages (because if it were too easy, it would take jobs away from French people who would be outcompeted for being too pricey to employ).
