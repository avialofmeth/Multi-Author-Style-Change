I went to a larger university in FL and like another commented, larger schools are typically way more understaffed leading to a lot of the issues I had. Your experiences is totally valid, and I have one like that too from back in TX when I first started my college journey. The community college I went to in TX was a similar experience for me as you described but it was a smaller college with about a 1:20 ratio of students to professors which really makes a difference.
