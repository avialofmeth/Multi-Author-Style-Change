In an example: an intersex person is born with a penis and ovaries (which really can happen!). Their sex is intersex but their gender is ??? In this case, gender is how the person feels - boy or girl would be appropriate. The gender is chosen by the individual. We all choose our genders, but it generally matches our sex.
