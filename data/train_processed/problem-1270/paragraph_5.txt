The good thing about modern treaties is that they establish a direct relationship between the Indigenous people and the government of the province, which simplifies talks and allows one Indigenous group of one province to have its "own" deal with the province, different from the "deals" in other provinces. Modern treaties add a lot of flexibility and create partnerships.
