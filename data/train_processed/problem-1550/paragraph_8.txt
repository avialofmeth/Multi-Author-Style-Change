Regarding Leopard deliveries, I'm all in for that and expect an announcement on the 20th - german media has been hinting at something. Regardless, as the german army has just above 100 operational tanks as a given time, do not expect more than 20 being delivered. The 1991 treaty + general desire of our neighbours to arm down since the 90's + absolute incompetence of the last few MoD's have done their part.
