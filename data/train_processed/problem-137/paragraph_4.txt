I was a little worried about the structure of the study given how shit a lot of social studies are (this coming from someone with a social related degree and still somehow learned statistics), but clicking through and reading the setup of having multiple interviews including an initial in-person one makes me feel a lot better than "an online survey", which would not be representative.
