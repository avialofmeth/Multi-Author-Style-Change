Truly the most humble and honest politician. Yes of course only Poland with itÂ´s perfect and trusting relationship to Germany could have possibly moved Germany to send the patriot system. Not of course the fact that Germany sent basically all kinds of air defense as much as it could. Iris-T, Gepards, Stinger and now the Patriot system. A system that before could not be sent as the US declined export permission when Ukraine asked. Now that the US is sending one system and is already training the Ukrainians in Germany on the system, they get a german system as well.
