Second, please go back to the 80s and 90s REMEMBER airwaves, newspapers, etc. They rarely painted Trump wrong. In fact, he was McDonald commercials and most Americans just found him a joke around that time. There were journalists that were barred from speaking against him: Taj Mahal. Not everyone knew that he was an ass. NY citizens that worked within the construction, real estate market did. But not everyone. Don't analyze things from the point of view of a millennial or gen Z that is not looking back.
