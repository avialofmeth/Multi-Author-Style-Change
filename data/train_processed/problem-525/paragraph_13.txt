It's not about the man at all. It's about the idea of a butcher losing to a pig, which would be funny in a fiction story. Notice how no one is using the man's name. If it were made real it wouldn't be fun or funny. It's only funny because they're putting the man out of mind and focusing just on the idea of the butcher vs pig, and turning it into fiction. No one has personal intent about it, they're just focusing on the one idea and distancing it from an ugly reality. Cuz if we dig into then we have to think about the safety practices in china, the slave labor used to produce our goods, the pollution poisoning their population, the freedoms their entire country will probably never have, and yes the man's death and his family. People have enough sad in their lives without actively hunting for it. So creating a fiction and focusing on that is a coping mechanism.
