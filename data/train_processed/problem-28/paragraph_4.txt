There’s also three forces that are technically part of the Russian Army but are practically independent warlord forces. The Donetsk and Luhansk People’s militias are the two first, consisting primarily of the force conscripted local men and women of East Ukraine, bolstered by some remaining Russian mercs and cossacks from the various Russian cossack hosts, primarily the Don Host, who are greatly enjoying this chance to partake in raiding the lands, properties and women of their centuries old rivals in the Zaporizhye Cossack Host. Finally there’s the Chechens, who are essentially the private army of Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord of Chechnya-Ichkeria. These guys are generally too valuable to risk in battle since they are keeping the Caucasus from exploding in Russia’s face again, and so they get the best equipment and plum positions well behind the front lines, where they do propaganda, shoot deserters and beat up units retreating without permission. On the rare occasions some are captured (usually during Ukrainian counteroffensives), the Russians will usually immediately trade Ukrainian prisoners for them, sometimes at a rate of three Ukrainians for each Chechen.
