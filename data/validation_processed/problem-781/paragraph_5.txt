I don’t like that idea, as much as I’m a progressive I also believe that states need to be linguistically rather than racially or ethnically homogenous. Thus I would support the annexation of the remaining polish and/or Lithuanian speaking communities that are contiguous with their home countries. The rest of Belarus, the Belarusian and most likely Russian speaking areas as well smooth the sake of not making an unholy landmass of a country akin to Middle Francia.
