I have thought from time to time that if I ever just wanted to get super rich and powerful, the easiest way would be to throw all of my morals and self respect out the window and join the GOP. I could just lie about anything and everything to a bunch of dumb hick rubes and take all their money while laughing all the way to the bank.
