I’m unsure of the name of the YouTube channel but it’s like a mapped battle sim and information is put in with weapon types/ranges/functionality and many of the fights turn real and raw real quick when the deaths mount. It goes in depth of jets diving and averting missiles and accounts for missiles that have better acquisition measures.
