It's an escort carrier. They were cheaper and could be built quickly since were most often built upon a commercial ship hull. The US built a lot of them during WW2 as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were scarce. They are inferior to the true aircraft carrier. The escort carriers are generally slower and have lighter arms and armor. They also carry fewer planes.
