The only way I would even consider not boycotting the Olympics is if there was a requirement that any athlete from Belarus or Russia explicitly condemn the war in Ukraine and denounce Putin as a war criminal. Then they can compete as a non-aligned athlete under a neutral flag. And no, I don't expect any to do that. Substantially all their athletes are in the military.
