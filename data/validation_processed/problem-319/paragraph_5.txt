It's sad that people keep trusting the DOJ and acting like this investigation isn't like the others. They've done enough investigations. The evidence is overwhelming. It's obvious to everybody capable of critical thinking that isn't a member of their cult. However, the investigations must continue because there isn't enough "evidence" yet. The truth is, there will never be enough evidence.
