Oh it will. His followers will say "he made the best out of a bad situation" which is absolute bullshit. If people think he's got this in the bag it's going to be a rude awakening. I'm not saying he will lose, but it's gonna be a tough race for him. I think it's gonna be a super low voter turnout this next election. A lot of people, including me, have just lost all hope in our government as a whole. That union thing was the nail in the coffin for a lot of us.
