Syria and the second Chechen war are examples of Russian wars of attrition in modern time. In both these conflicts the enemy had collaborators within to help Russians win. What they lack right now is a significant 5th column in Ukrainian upper command. The people Russia paid off to be collaborators in the government have been either snuffed out or ran away.

Thus Legitimizing the win and winning over the population by saying “see it was Ukrainians who ousted their illegitimate leader”.
