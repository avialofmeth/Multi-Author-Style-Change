Bro, if you don't like islam is fine. But please don't bring news just to fit your narrative. Indonesia is a multicultural country and has plenty of diverse religions and animism or dynamism. The only religion that was forced in Indonesia recently was Christianity.. It was forced by the colonialism regime. Most of us were taught how, Christianity, Hindu, Buddhism and Islam spread in Indonesia. Most of the Kingdoms in Indonesia converted to Islam due to trading and later on the kings. If you read how Kingdom raised and fell in Indonesia, Hinduism and Buddhism kingdom were also fought each other in Indonesia. During the last hindu King, they ran away because they didn't agree to convert to Islam. Hindu was already minority by then. This is probably 14th century or something.
