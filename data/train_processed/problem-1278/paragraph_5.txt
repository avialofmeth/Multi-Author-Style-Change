I’ve read about all those actually. None of it is perfect. Could we as a nation forbid all companies based in the US to get out of Russia? I bet we could, but I, not sure. And boycott the ones who aren’t based here but still do business there. ( IKEA comes to mind) We could’ve stopped this war months ago but seem bent on keeping it going. Like I said it’s far from perfect , the way it’s playing out. War has always been a boost to a slow economy. Is this what’s happening ? It’s a strategy ?
