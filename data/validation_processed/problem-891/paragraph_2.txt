Oh dude, our misguided gov has given licence to reopen a coal mine and restart a few coal fired power stations. And the coal we have left is dirty sulferous stuff, not good. The energy producing companies are raking in the profits, whilst citizens go hungry and cold due to sky high, unaffordable energy costs.
