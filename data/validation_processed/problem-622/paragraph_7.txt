For the rest of these Russian soldier’s, officer’s, and politician’s lives, they will be hunted down and punished for their war crimes. When Ukraine wins this war, these people will never be able to leave Russia without the risk of getting arrested and extradited to Ukraine to stand trial for their atrocities. If there is ever a regime change in Russia like we saw in Germany at the end of WWII, they will be at risk at home as well.
