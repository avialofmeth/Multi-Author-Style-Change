The actors, who were 15 and 16 years old at the time, say they were assured they could wear flesh-coloured underwear during the bedroom scene, but on the morning of the shoot were pressured to perform naked, against their wishes. Subsequently they were assured that no nudity would be visible in the final cut, but Whiting's bare bottom and Hussey's bare breasts are visible in the final film. The actors are suing the studio for sexual exploitation and distribution of nude images of a minor.
