Trump had money and a solid political sense. This guy has none. He went from being the second leader of the leading far right party (the national front) to almost nothing, by doing the wrong choices during the covid crisis, while the National front is still thriving (albeit under a new name). I am very wary of some far-right leaders, but not him.
