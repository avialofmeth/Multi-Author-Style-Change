russia bombed us on New Years' eve, shelled Kherson killing 20+ people, bombed us on our Christmas, and every single other day. And even when they are not bombing us they are torturing and killing people every single day on occupied territories so there is no way we can ever stop until people are free. They are waiting for us.
