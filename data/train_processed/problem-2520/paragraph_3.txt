There’s a modern Simpsons episode from a few years ago where Elon Musk guest stars and the whole episode is about him, and he’s introduced by Lisa as the world’s last great inventor. They even go as far as to have him end up in Springfield by crashing a rocket ship in the Simpson’s backyard. Makes me so angry on multiple levels because A. literally none of that is true B. It’s clear he bought himself an episode to get his ego stroked and C. Modern Simpsons bad.
