Scotland had a vote in 2014, you can't have a vote every time something changes else when do you stop? Do you say only major changes? But there will be a grey line between major and medium etc so where do you stop? Scotland had a fair vote and decided to stay. You have to stay through thick and thin not just while the good times roll.
