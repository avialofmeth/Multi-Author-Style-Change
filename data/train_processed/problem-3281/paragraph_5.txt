2022 should have been a huge win, but it wasn't, and the reason for that is more Trump than McDaniel. Without a doubt, McDaniel, McConnell and McCarthy should have done a lot more to keep Trump way the heck out of the way, but they feared Trump would tell his most avid supporters not to vote for Republican nominees in the general election. The GOP now NEEDS the MAGA vote, and they have to do whatever needs doing to keep Trump happy enough.
