We are running out of things to consume with 9billion people on the planet. It will inevitably be each other. As far as health insurance, evil is a stretch as I don’t feel superstition adds to reality. Health Insurance is capitalism at its finest because healthy people are not as profitable as sick people—if you keep people sick, they will be at your consumption table with a possibly calculable interval. Apologies in advance. Whiskey is hitting hard.
