Regarding Biden, if some of these documents date back to his time in the Senate, and to some extent while he was VP, it’s either unlikely or impossible that he was authorized to remove these from a secure location. So it seems that the key point was whether he knowingly removed them. That’s TBD and likely a big part of the current investigation. As I said, I doubt either of these guys get serious charges or certainly not prison time but to say it’s not a serious issue also not correct.
