So, it sounds like a lot more equipment from US surplus is about to be unloaded. The US usually lists those items with the cost to purchase them directly, even if they are the US getting rid of surplus equipment and saving on maintenance and storage. Still, great news. I wonder what toys Ukraine is getting.
