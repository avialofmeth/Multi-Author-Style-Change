Heck, look at where Russia attacked a distracted Germany early in the war and lost, horribly. Russia in WW1 was a story of defeat after defeat, with their only successes being against the even more backwards Austria Hungary, and that was a large reason for the revolution, no different than after the Russo-Japanese war where a similar defeat caused an uprising against the Tsar.
