Yes, the war propaganda of today is as transparently cringeworthy as the whole 'slap a Jap' from WWII. And you're just as outcast if you don't clap along. I'm trusted well enough that I can say the occasional "You do know that the West has its own propaganda filter, right? At least Russia is physically close to Ukraine so some people have seen it directly." I've seen it from both sides and the tolerance for dissent is pretty much the same as in Russia (though there you might get criminal charges rather than downvotes, so meh).
