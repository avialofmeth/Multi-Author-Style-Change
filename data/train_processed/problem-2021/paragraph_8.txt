Completely agree, but I've noticed that negative conservation news stories (e.g. oil spills, mass strandings of whales, etc.) get a ton of interaction on Reddit even if the event was localized to a relatively small area "on the other side of the world" and wouldn't directly affect most Redditors. And the comments are typically full of environmental catastrophizing that may not necessarily reflect the reality of the situation -- for example, whale strandings and penguin breeding failures are sad, but typically natural events that most experts don't immediately panic about.
