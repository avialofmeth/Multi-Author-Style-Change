Russian air defence is actually one of the things they have that's working. Both Russia and Ukraine are using mostly the same air defence systems. The result is very little air activity overall by big stuff like planes and a bigger focus on small systems that the air defence wasn't designed to counter (because drones weren't really the same thing back in the late Cold War era).
