I live in Georgia and feel the runoffs are gonna be closer than they should be. How do you reach Republican voters that are voting for Walker despite all of his issues? I know several people that are voting for Walker simply because he’s a Republican, even though they can’t stand him. They think Warnock is automatically worse than Walker simply because he’s a Democrat.
