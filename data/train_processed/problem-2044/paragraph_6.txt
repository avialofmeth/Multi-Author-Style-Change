The thinking that you have to feel a certain way to be a female or a male is fundamentally flawed and stems from a popularized (thus watered down) debate with feminism. A gender has a multitude of ways how to be lived, and this idea that you don't feel you're a certain gender, is a byproduct of this failed philosophy. Feminists and gender philosophers who've been struggling for decades to remove the stereotypical attributes from women or men are probably rolling in graves seeing how the whole society built an idea exactly around the attributes defining women or men.
