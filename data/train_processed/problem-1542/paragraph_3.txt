What mitigating factors are there for supporting someone who does such harm? Being threatened into "support" is one thing, wholeheartedly throwing yourself into it because some guy has convinced you that you are better than some lesser guy? Maybe when someone throws their own life away in this manner, they weren't a great person to begin with. They foundationally need to believe they are better than "those" people to support that trash.
