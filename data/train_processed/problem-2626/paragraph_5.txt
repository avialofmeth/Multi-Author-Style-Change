Thereafter, the Russian "peace keeping" mission will have no peace to keep since the Armenians they were sent to protect will no longer exist. With no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh they will merely be seen by the Azeri public as an occupying force. Then Aliyev will cry to the West that the Russians are occupying its internationally recognized territory. Russia might eventually leave with some sort of an economic/financial deal with Azerbaijan and just like that, the dictator in Azerbaijan will have what he always wanted. All of Karabakh.
