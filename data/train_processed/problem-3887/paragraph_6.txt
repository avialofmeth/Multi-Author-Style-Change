Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, on the other hand, share direct borders with either ruzzia or Belaruz. There are relatively few rivers or mountains to slow an attack down, and aside from Poland, they have precious little land to trade for time and reinforcements. They are relatively flat, and the theory before the war in Ukraine was that a massed tank assault would tear through quickly if they were not well defended. Now we know that isn't something ruzzia can really pull off, but still. There is also the fact that it would likely be easier to pull off naval attacks from the Baltic than the Black Sea. The ruzzians do not have nearly the same force projection or reinforcement capabilities in the Black sea, and are limited by Turkey's control over the straits.
