My wife is applying to PhD programs, too. She has a bachelors and a masters. She paid less than $100 in tuition for both her degrees. Several of her friends—who went to the same school—are already enrolled in American doctoral programs. Since most doctoral programs offer both funding and tuition waivers, all of them will graduate with no student loan debt. They will—eventually—join the workforce free from the pressures of any and all repayment.
