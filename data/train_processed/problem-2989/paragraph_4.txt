The city block statement is just a crude calculation based on mass (500KG) x velocity and converting that energy into TNT (its surprisingly high). The Americans did also develop the "Ninja" Hellfire missile. Where they can fire the missile at say a taxi and decide which occupant in the taxi they want to slice and dice. Leaving the other occupants unharmed from the missile but the car is a total write off. Just so thry can minimise the collateral damage.
