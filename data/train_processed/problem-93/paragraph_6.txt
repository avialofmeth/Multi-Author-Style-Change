Then there's problem 3 - Ukraine wants to ally with West. Russia needs to invade countries every now and then to mask their domestic issues and there's a problem here - you can't invade NATO members because it's too powerful. And Ukraine is not just a random country either. It's big, has over 40 million people, had quite impressive military production capabilities alongside with food production and it also was part of Russia until not that long ago (and it was allied with it until like what, a mere decade ago, not even that).
