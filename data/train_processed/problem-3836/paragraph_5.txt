For the biggest part - Russia's goals and red lines are all written in sand. "Denazification" can mean litrally anything after all. And government has total control over media. It has already gone from "we will destroy this shit excuse of a country in 3 days" to "don't expect fast victory, we are facing second strongest army in Europe" to "Ukrainians are using US supplied biolabs to turn themselves into horrifying monsters without any shred of humanity left" to "We are facing combined power of the entire NATO, that counteroffensive included entire platoons of Polish snipers and western mercenaries, there's USA soldier in every division".
