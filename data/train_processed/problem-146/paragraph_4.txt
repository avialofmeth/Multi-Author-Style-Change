All the grocery stores in my area shut down all the bulk food items and replaced them with pre-packaged plastic containers. Even the pastries and buns that you could buy loose got replaced with pre-packaged clamshell containers. All in an effort to cut down on touching surfaces. Covid resulted in a huge increase in single use plastic when I feel like society was just about to start reducing it.
