If China is serious about developing their own home-grown advanced fab processes, they are a solid 10 to 15 years out from being able to achieve what TSMC can do today. The amount of effort required to secure their own fab industry is sufficiently high that I really wonder if it woudl be less effort on their part to risk war with the West by trying to capture Taiwan.
