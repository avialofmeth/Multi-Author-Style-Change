What school choice really means, is picking other parents you think are doing a good job at parenting. Apart from that, the schools don't really differ that much. My daughter and her friend from private school had the exact same text books and the curriculum was basically the same. The class sizes were the same. And the teachers had similar credentials. The only real difference is one place was exclusive and catered to wealthier families, and the other one took anyone who enrolled.
