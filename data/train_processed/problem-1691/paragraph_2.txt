Just quickly perusing their hot posts right now, it's mostly train derailment conspiracy stuff, but there are also a few pure anti-vaxx misinfo posts, one homophobic post, some pro-authoritarian stuff (praising Gaddafi ffs), some guy hilariously claiming oil doesn't come from dead dinos and also dinos didn't go extinct until just 100,000 years ago, some Greta Thunberg hate, several posts only slightly masking their anti-semitism in a veil of "ackshully Epstein wasn't the mastermind - it was the Jews" type posts, and a whole bunch of "Biden is Evil and the Media is Covering It Up" posts.
