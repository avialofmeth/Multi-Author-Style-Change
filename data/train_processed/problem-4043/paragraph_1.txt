Probably not, but if he does run, he'd probably win NH, both taking votes from and ultimately denying the win to DeSantis--he's currently ahead and let's just say he stays ahead for argument--(both candidates could appeal to the "I'm sane, I'm not voting for Trump" demographic). Trump would take 2nd place, and get a leg-up for SC, where Graham & a former governor have endorsed Trump. Also, if both Haley and Scott from SC run, again, they put Trump in first place there.
