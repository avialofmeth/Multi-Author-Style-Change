The problem with Putin's ministers is not that they're incompetent, but that he won't tolerate a minister that would dare to act on his own. So, even if the minister is capable of doing his job well and in good faith, he won't, if he wants to keep his job. Putin's ministers are cowards, even the most brilliant ones (like ), hanging on puppet strings. What those of them, not indiffirent to the state of the country, say to themselves, is something like: "If not me in this place, he'll find someone even worse".
