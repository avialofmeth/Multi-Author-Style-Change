Dems have made huge gains in swing states with some trend of over-performing in states with balanced maps or states drawn by independent commissions. Dems are underperforming in NY and CA, where they control the map-drawing. The new NY districts where theyâ€™ve lost are largely pro-Biden districts, with some being D+10. Those are winnable races that they lost due to bad state campaigns in NY.
