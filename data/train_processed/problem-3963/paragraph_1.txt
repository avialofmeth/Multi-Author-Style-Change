If there is any "crisis" at the border, it's that our immigration policies are broken and don't allow enough realistic ways for people to immigrate here legally without some herculean effort. The US and it's drug and gun policies have created absolute chaos in some Central and South American countries via the cartels, and this has led to people fleeing those countries in search of asylum. We need to let people seeking refuge into the country to lead productive lives (because lord knows we have plenty of jobs that need to be filled), and then we need to stop the drug war that's giving the cartels power, and increase gun control so we quit arming those same cartels. Most of the people trying to come to America only are doing so because we've helped make life in their home countries untenable.
