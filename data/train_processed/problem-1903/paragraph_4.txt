Armenia is relatively small… but far far from ‘brink of extinction’. As a matter of fact, thanks to this war, Armenia is on a brink of huge economic jump (as most of countries around Russia). Armenia just had massive injection of Russian immigrants and quite a few big businesses moved to Armenia from Russia (if I remember correctly, Russian office of Google relocated to Armenia).
