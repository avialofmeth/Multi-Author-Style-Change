I never even heard Ilhan (one of my favorite congresspeople) say "Jews", but I constantly hear the Right mentioning Jews, usually in non-complimentary context. Like treating them like a monolith, equating them to Israel, inappropriately evoking nazi regime/Holocaust to compare it to something they don't like or Space lasers.
