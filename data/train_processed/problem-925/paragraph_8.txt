Undoubtedly gun rights and the fight around it is impossible to grasp for French people. The claim that more guns bring more safety defies their sense of rationality. After the tragic event in Chesapeake today, I saw statistics pointing out that the United States has already witnessed more than 620 mass shootings since the beginning of the year, compared to zero in France. What is even more troubling is the type of weapons used in those mass shootings, which are models we can almost use in Ukraine today: the AR-15, the high-capacity magazinesâ€¦ When I was driving in the United States, I was determined not to enter into any arguments in the case of a minor collision (which never happened), because I felt something totally unexpected could happen.
