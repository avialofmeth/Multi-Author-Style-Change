Democrats on Sunday were celebrating retaining their majority in the Senate after Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) was projected to win reelection, even as control of the House remained undetermined. Her victory secured the 50th Senate seat for Democrats and quashed Republicansâ€™ hopes of taking control of both chambers of Congress, as many had predicted in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
