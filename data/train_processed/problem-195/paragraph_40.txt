I'm genuinely puzzled. You're saying if Shamima Begum grew up in Bangladesh with a parent with UK citizenship, but without actually getting UK citizenship herself, that it would be the law working as intended if the situation happened in reverse - Bangladesh strips her of citizenship and she should apply for UK citizenship?
