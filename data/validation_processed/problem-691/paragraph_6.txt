The sunflowers I didn't even plant are now 5'6" tall and are sporting yellow flowers, despite a straight week of freezing mornings. I have wrapped a Build-Yer-Own Skateboard kit for one of my nephews, and have also included wrist guards in case his dad raises an eyebrow. Soon I will get some applewood chips rolling in the smoker so I can start prepping an elk roast and some duck wings/legs/hearts for tomorrow's supper.
