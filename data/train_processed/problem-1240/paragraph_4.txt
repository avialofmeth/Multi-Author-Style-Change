However(and I know this is uncomfortable), ethnic cleansing was not always considered genocidal or even called that. It used to be a method of relocating ethnicities to be with others in an effort to "help" them "self determine". Usually it was the former colonial master countries that did this when overseeing decolonization. And despite how scummy that is by our standards now, it wasn't an outright malicious attempt to destroy or remove, but an ignorant solution to create a form of harmony(I know, I know. Reaaally dumb).
