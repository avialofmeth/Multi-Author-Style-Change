Arguably (the arguments are bad, but they're there) it's not, which is why China is so annoyed with Putin. China has consistently said that because Taiwan is "special" in that they never established sovereignty on a global-scale (deeply flawed argument, but technically true since even the US has been slow to recognize them) they are different from countries like Ukraine and (reading between the lines) therefore can be invaded without violation of sovereignty.
