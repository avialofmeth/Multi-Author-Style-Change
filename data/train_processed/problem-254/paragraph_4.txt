ugh, I know we're joking but this is all based on real shit. Like "America's Mayor" from 9/11 really stood out there and ranted about election fraud without evidence but with spray-on hair color dripping down his head. And it's very likely he rented a space at a 4 Seasons feed and seed when he meant to do it at a 4 Seasons hotel. And people REALLY trust that guy when he says "Hunter Biden's laptop has all this crazy stuff on it but you can't see it and even though the FBI looked at it and said it wasn't there, it really is, just trust me.".
