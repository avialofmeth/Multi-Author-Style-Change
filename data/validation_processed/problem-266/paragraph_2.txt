Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges. This is just one example out of a million in the line from raw uranium to weapons grade.
