I don’t disagree that corporate media is a class apparatus no matter what flavor it comes in, my point was your initial post reduces it to “they all do this” in a topic that is unique to fox and also ignores the magnitudes of greater domestic damage Fox does. You aren’t going to get people calling in bomb threats to children’s hospitals from CNN coverage.
