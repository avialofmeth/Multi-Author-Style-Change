That said, my math (been tracking in a spreadsheet and assuming poor to average performance in outstanding votes outside Maricopa) showed that before this data Hobbs only needed like 39% of the remaining vote in Maricopa, and with this latest GOP underperformance that has changed so that Lake would need to hit 66-34 in tomorrow's (basically final) drop to win, which isn't happening.
