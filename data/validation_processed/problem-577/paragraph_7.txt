Unfortunately we live with his conservative boomer father who thinks its because he doesn't want a job. The other jobs either require a degree which he technically earned but wasn't given(the professor made the news when it came out she was purposely failing male students even though they passed their exams), or the rest are minimum wage jobs which won't even hire him because he has to explain what hes been doing for the past few years which is a long explanation that they refuse to listen too.
