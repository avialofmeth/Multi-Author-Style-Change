No progress is being made on those though, because they don't get people angry like guns do. It's much easier to score easy political points within your party by attacking/defending conceptually simple concepts like gun ownership than it is to do it by laying the groundwork for real structural change. In the long run though, that attitude means nothing changes at all, because we're bickering over minutiae rather than actually addressing root causes.
