America could never be militarily invaded. It could be destroyed by weapons of mass destruction or "occupied" in a civil war, but the resources a nation-state would need to logistically support an invasion of the continental US would be immense. No country has that capability right now, and no nation has the capability to bypass or destroy the Navy and Air Force that would almost certainly destroy an invasion fleet.
