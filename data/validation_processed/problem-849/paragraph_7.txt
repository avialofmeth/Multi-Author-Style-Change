If your stance is that people who claim "virtuous opinions" are 100% genuine in those opinions, that is extremely naive and I wouldn't bank on that. For example, nearly everyone you run into now claims "being gay is ok and acceptable". How much do people get mocked for just exhibiting gay tendencies? Not even fucking close to zero.
