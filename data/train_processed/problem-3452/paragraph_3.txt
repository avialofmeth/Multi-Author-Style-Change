There is a difference between coalition falling and coalition advancing elections by a few months. Sometimes it is advanced just because parties don't like the elections to happen in November (when an automatic end of term happens) or because they think that loosing just of few months in power is well worth of making some grand standing during budget negotiations. 2015th government held for 4 years and 25 days, 2009th government held 9 days short of 4 years.
