Being from IL, I remember Joe Walsh and his election to Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Prior to that he was a radio host in the Chicago area. An absolutely disgusting human being. Donâ€™t let his anti-Trump rhetoric fool you, this guy is pure scum and has terrible right wing positions on nearly every issue.
