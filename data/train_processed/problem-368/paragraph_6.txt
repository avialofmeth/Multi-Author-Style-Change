Turkey's image will start to improve if they actually vote out their fascist strong man. Most of the world seems to hate Americans, especially after Trump. If we are all accountable for the actions of our government, why is Turkey any different? I think it's absurd to tell me not to call out the poor Turks when their best known export for the last 200 years has been genocide.
