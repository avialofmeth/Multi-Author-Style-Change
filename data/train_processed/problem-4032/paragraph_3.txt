Certain large companies have been enlisted as 'model' companies to pilot the schemes, which I assume is intended to demonstrate how successful these are, iron out some kinks with companies that can absorb the shock from beginners' mistakes, and solve issues to stop smaller companies from complaining once it is rolled out further and becomes mandatory. (These policies are issued as part of 5-year-plans, and the current 5-year-plan establishes the policies and pilot schemes).
