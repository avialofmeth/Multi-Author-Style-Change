Calling this water “nuclear waste” is an exaggeration. Concentration of the radioactive particles in the water is the key. They are proposing to release water containing very dilute amounts of radioactive particles. The water will be scrubbed of radioactive material and will be further diluted once it is in the ocean. This is cleaned up cooling water that has been stockpiled since the accident, not hot waste.
