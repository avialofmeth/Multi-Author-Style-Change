While this is a decent idea for overall national security threats, I would have thought we already do this via the FBI/DHS, especially in DC. I could be wrong though. What good will security cameras do for a Jan 6 situation? The whole thing was filmed anyway. There have been countless arrests of brainwashed pawns. What we have already seems to be working.
