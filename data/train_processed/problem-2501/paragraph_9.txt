The additional complication is that FTX is actually 2 exchanges: there’s the main FTX which operates pretty much everywhere but the US, and then FTX.US, which operates in only the US. FTX.US exists because the US feds wouldn’t allow FTX to operate in the US without additional regulation. FTX US supposedly has been operating within more stringent regulations, and has assets on hand to cover investor funds - but we’ll see if that holds up and to what extent anyone could be prosecuted here in the US.
