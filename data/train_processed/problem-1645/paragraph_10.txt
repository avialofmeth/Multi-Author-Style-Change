I've always thought announcing retroactive 0% interest on all federal student loans would be more politically palatable (it might shut up the "you took out a loan, pay it back" people) AND way, WAY more beneficial to way more people. Most people I know who still have student loan balances 10, 15 years after graduating have way more than paid back their principal balance already.
