You’re right about the 9% vat on groceries, my bad. Income tax is determined on income levels or boxes. The first box income to €68.508 is 37,10% , the second €69.399 is 49.50% . Then there are all kinds of taxes because I drive a company car and so on. So I work the first 4 hours of the day for the government. Yes I’m having a good income……but if you divide this by the hours I make I am not earning much more the the average income per hour. And because I have the funds to invest in solar energie on power and warm water, alternative heating , electric car. I can take advantage of the subsidies provided by the government. This is at cost of the lower incomes but I get some of my payed taxes back.
