When it comes to the base they no longer watch anything on Fox News except from Tucker. They are huge when it comes to conservatives but the base considers them too liberal. You have to understand the base is hard core Trump followers and Fox not only had to many liberal commentators like Chris Wallace but they made the unforgivable mistake of being the first to call Arizona for Biden. They do still watch Tucker but this revelation if they believe will change that. They often tend to disregard things they don’t want to hear. Hell, Fox News has been trying to replace Trump with DeSantis since about last June or July yet another reason Fox is not something Trumps base watches. You just don’t try to replace their hero and remain their choice of where they get what they want to hear to reinforce their beliefs.
