I’m really tired of people commenting about Iran when they know absolutely nothing about it or its history, culture, or politics, and have zero desire to learn. They just fill in the gaps of their ignorance with random terrible news they’ve come across, Orientalist tropes from media, and sand n-word and are shocked to discover they’re in fact regular people. I swear at least 90% of Reddit comments regarding Iran are hot garbage.
