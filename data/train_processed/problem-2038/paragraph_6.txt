It's difficult for me to explain how I feel, it comes across sounding like I saying, to quote someone else, "I'm a woman, vote for me!" and I'm not; I care about qualifications far more than I care about skin color or wardrobe, reading the headlines about first this and first that are just add-on benefits for me, like buying a car with the highest impact safety rating and it also has that new-car smell.
