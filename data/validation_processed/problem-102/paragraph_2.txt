As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.
