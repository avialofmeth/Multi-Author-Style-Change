Not barbarous savages no, really a complex people with extraordinary metallurgy skills and strong developed society. I’ve since taken to dislike the term “barbarian” when describing them and feel guilty for using it in the past in that way. I’m not calling you out by the way…I’m just saying they were a well-developed civilized people. But if course with certain features that we would now consider very cruel and nasty, but more or less normal among many cultures globally during those times.
