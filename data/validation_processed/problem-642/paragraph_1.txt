The problem is that in too many places single family housing is the only type that can be built, there are zoning laws preventing the building of high capacity housing, there are NIMBYs who complain about the skyline and bemoan the demolition of historic parking lots, there are ordinances all over saying what can be built where and for what purposes, and the result is that the demand for housing is significantly outstripping the supply.
