Honestly like 10 years ago when I was technically anti trans, even then I then didn't question the bathroom thing. I just didn't understand the whole trans thing but y'know, I gained some trans friends over the years and got my questions answered pretty nicely. I feel bad for having doubts in the first place but at least I learned from it. it really is no ones business whatsoever and the GOP really is a bunch of bullshit. I'm sorry to everyone because I voted republican in 2016 and that I got suckered into their shit. I'm so fucking sorry god damn I can never let down that regret. I've had a few drinks and I'm going through shit right now so like sorry guys once again. dark brandon will rise above all.
