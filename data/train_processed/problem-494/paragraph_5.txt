So protecting Taiwan, even if not an official ally, is SO essential to the West, they may be absolutely willing to wage WW3 over it... because if China takes it, then for the next 10 years minimum the West will be FORCED to lick China's boots. (Likely longer since China will then invest to stay these 10 years ahead).
