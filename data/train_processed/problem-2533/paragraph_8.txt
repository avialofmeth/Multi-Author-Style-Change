In Maricopa County, all ballots printed and filled out on Election Day were counted by 2AM Wednesday morning (aside from about 17K with printer issues, 12K of which were counted in Friday or Saturday's batch). And most of the mail-ins received by the Saturday before Election Day were signature-verified and counted prior to Election Day, and released in the initial batch. So we're left with a gray zone of early ballots received by mail or dropped off between Saturday and Tuesday, and those are being counted in the order received (i.e., ballots dropped off at precincts closer to downtown were counted first, and suburban/exurban fringes of the metro area further from the counting center are getting processed last).
