US isn't the world. Plenty of democracies have chosen liberty, freedom of association, free media, separation of state and religion, democracy and rule of law, transparency of governance, transparent voting, human rights. This is not a US hegemony. Russia and China are frustrated, autocratic, one part, corrupt dictatorships that have more issues with containing and oppressing their citizens as opposed to any outside threats. Their world order would be a disaster.
