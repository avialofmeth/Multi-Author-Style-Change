You presume he acts with complete rationality. But how often has Kim been rational? He’s had people put to death by mauling, he’s building nuclear capable ICBM’s, he has families imprisoned for generations. Does not sound like a rational clear thinking person. Kim has openly said he wants a war, I’d listen to what he wants ( and then be ready to push back).
