No certainly not ww1 ended 18 this would make anybody born at the end of ww1 105 years old only about 1 in 1000 people life to that age and only 1 in 1000000 live to 110 with the oldest person ever being around 120 but now since those soldiers died in the war their children must have been born during it making them even older. So in all likly hood there are maybe 2 children of those soldiers left a life but 0 is more is more likly.
