The problem I see though, is that no country is going to realistically want to feed into mass hysteria and escalate a nuclear war into doomsday, even after a nuclear strike was made. Putin isn't willing to start a nuclear war with the West, he'd be ended for sure, but are you sure he isn't willing to strike Ukraine and catch the West on a bluff that they'd end life as we know it over a single incident? If things get bad enough then that may be the only card he'd have left to try and turn things around with.
