Let's put it this way: would you be more scared of a guy who owns a gun but keeps it at home, or a guy actively waving the gun around in public with his finger on the trigger? Now imagine that gun is a nuke. And as much as we like to make fun of North Korea for it, it seems to be working quite well. North Korea is not getting messed with through military means (granted, that we know of) and they aren't like Iran who is getting their facilities bombed by outside powers. Because North Korea has nukes. And more importantly because they are constantly making others remember they have a willingness to use such weapons if needed.
