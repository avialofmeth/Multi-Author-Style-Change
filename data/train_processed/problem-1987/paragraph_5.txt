I love the “opportunities” to work in the labs for FREE because they are great “resume builders.” Which means only rich kids can afford to do those “jobs” because who can do 20 hours in the lab and still do another 20 at a real job to make enough to survive? These practices clearly take advantage of students. If they work, they should be fairly paid.
