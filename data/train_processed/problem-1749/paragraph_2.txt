That’s crazy I will say that at least you have a public transportation system, we only have busses in major cities the biggest have limited rapid trains - very limited. If I want to go to to a city 6-7 hours away from where I live I have to drive, there is no transit of any kind that will take me there, possibly I could fly IF that city has an airport…. We did have greyhound bus lines which you could buy a ticket to drive between city’s on but they were a private company that shut down.
