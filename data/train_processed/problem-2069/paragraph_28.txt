It's one of the things I am against. I believe in media and journalism. I do not believe in those institutions being bought by public option companies UNLESS their stockholders names and country of origin are declared. With a caveat that foreign countries can only buy collectively less than 3%. Similar for investment funds, similar for private enterprise. Basically I don't want a foreign government masquerading as private citizens owning a news paper. Politico for example.
