Not meant to justify or excuse it. But no way should US criticise and not expect some justification for their actions as well. As a matter of fact, the best thing the US could do is stop playing world police, accept some accountability for its own actions also for once and become a signatory of the ICC so the victims of its war crimes/resource lootings can be given justice.
