The HARM missiles have been the unsung hero of Ukrainian defense. MANPAD's and HIMARS get all the attention but it's thanks to air-launched anti-radiation missiles that Russia was never able to gain air-superiority. In the early stages of the invasion Ukrainian engineers figured out how to interface the NATO supplied missiles to their Soviet-era warplanes and they've been brutally effective. Any Russian battery radar operator foolish enough to switch their radar on can expect an incoming missile in short order.
