I just finished a college course that studied the FBI and Homeland Security taught by a former Secret Service and FBI agent. We covered this particular issue. When they say the FBI got a tip, it means someone called the 1-800 number. They get thousands of “tips” each day, they get sorted through and sent to field offices. It takes time to sort through tips though. Also, if one has not committed the crime yet and it’s not known there’s a plan- it makes it difficult to stop. The tip would have to kick up an investigation before arrests are made- again taking time.
