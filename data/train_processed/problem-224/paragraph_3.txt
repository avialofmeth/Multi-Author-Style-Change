Western citizens are far removed from the war, but their posture and by extension that of their governments is a material factor in the outcome of the war. Itâ€™s almost guaranteed that on large social media platforms there are government-sponsored efforts to influence public opinion in the West towards this war, from both sides of the conflict. And they would be foolish not to make such an effort. This is just as important as counterintel or any other spying / propaganda efforts. We should all be vigilant in checking for that bias in what we consume here.
