A lot of assumptions here. Putin will keep mobilising troops, the issue is thst they have broken command structure and inability to make mobilised troops usable (and quickly), they lost a fair amount of their core forces and just the fact that he delegated significant portion of the offensive action to a private firm tells a lot.
