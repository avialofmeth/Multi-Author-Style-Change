How unreasonable would it be if Poland deployed a sort of “peacekeeping” force with anti air batteries (no offensive weapons, only defensive ones) inside the Ukrainian territory (like in and around Lvov) and essentially force Russia to stop launching missiles in that general direction unless Putin actively wanted to escalate shit further. And if by any chance russia wants wants to keep fucking around and then accidentally hit polish soldiers extend the no fly zone to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea….
