Biggest issue for Russia in regards to its nukes isn’t theft I think, but rather the tritium in the warheads. It’s the spark plugs that ignite the fuel once the initial fusion blast provides the charge, so to speak. I can’t remember the half life of tritium off the top of my head, but I think it is like 11 years or something like that? Of course you can replace it with freshly refined tritium from a reactor, but most Soviet reactors that could do that are no longer within Russian borders, oe have shut down. I do not know how many still are usable. I think there’s one near Chelyabinsk? Regardless, I have a strong suspicion Russia’s functional nuclear arsenal is considerably smaller than the thousands of warheads they have on paper. I wouldn’t be shocked if it is in the low four digit or even the three digit range.
