Of course there's another issue that is rarely discussed, and that's just how disjointed the PLA is. Just like the Russian military, the PLA's branches rarely communicate between one another. Sure they put on those amazing displays of coordination during their military exercises between units and even branches. But those are all just preplanned; and if hastily thrown together, like those Taiwan "drills" that China did when Pelosi visited, just common drills that were practiced for hours before that "look" good and impressive.
