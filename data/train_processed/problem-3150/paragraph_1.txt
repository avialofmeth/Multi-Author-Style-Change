Religion is no longer needed in modern life. Conservative christians have claimed that a fall in christianity would be the fall of the US. However, christianity has been nose diving since the 90s, and crime is down 50%, divorce hit a 50 year low in 2019, and there were fewer abortions in 2021 than there were in 1972 before Roe v Wade made its way through the courts. The drop in religion did not cause these other things to get better, but the drop did nothing to make them worse.
