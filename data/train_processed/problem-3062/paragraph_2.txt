Its just that there is always something more important to spend production or gold on, they kind of get shoved to the end. Even when I get them for free randomly from finding a tribal village, they are kind of use full for a few turns before they get cornered by barbarians. Galleys are my preferred exploration method, and for land just send out 2-3 horsemen that travel faster and are stronger.
