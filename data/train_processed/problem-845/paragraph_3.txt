ultimately, police dont prevent crime, they react to crime, and having an incarceration splurge for minor offences is just kicking the can down the road. there might be an immediate drop in crime rates but once everyone is out after a few years and can't find a job because of their record, it will expound the current rates. the best solution is to tackle the root causes of criminal behaviour, but that's not as 'sexy' as tought on crime, police on every corner' rhetoric. 'softer' approaches (like what progressives espouse) take longer, but it costs less overall, and provides a myriad of long term benefits in addition to a lower crime rate.
