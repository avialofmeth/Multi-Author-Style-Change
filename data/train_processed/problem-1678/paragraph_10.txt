It's why I added the part about sabotage. Sabotage can come in many forms, even in the form of not carrying out your duties or carrying them out poorly. Or it can be actual sabotage of military equipment, fragging a commander, or any of the more traditional forms of sabotage. Conscripted soldiers on the front lines will have opportunities to surrender or defect, or if they're worried about their families plenty of opportunities for sabotage that aren't extremely risky.
