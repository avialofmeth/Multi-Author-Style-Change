Sounds a lot easier than it is. A low-earth orbit may run at any angle N-S-E-W and also altitude, which can vary with time, ie. it doesn't have to have a circular orbit. To hit it you need to match trajectories. To do that using something you already have in orbit (on some other trajectory) that something has to have tremendous delta-v capability, ie. thruster, & fuel for said thruster. Sats can change trajectory a little but to completely warp around to match something else is a whole different ball game.
