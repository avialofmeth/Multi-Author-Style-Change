Yes, it amazes me how their unhinged logic is twisted and turned. How dare Ukraine defend its self, how dare they retaliate. Only we can attack them. Only we can blow up their cities and towns.... but if they touch our Crimean Bridge its a war crime and an act of terrorism and we will retaliate ... more than we have already. I know it's just for domestic consumption but Russia would have to the must distrusted, disrespected and most ridiculed country in the eyes of the world right now. They just lie and make shit up with their shameless double speak propaganda.
