Besides the WTF Germany, allow Ukraine to get all the tanks it needs logic, an interesting comment on the US Abrams tank. The same criticism when it was built being hugely expensive, hard to maintain and a logistics nightmare without providing a real edge over . Abrams costs close to TWICE that of the Leopard and costs three times to maintain and fuel. Shows problem with US spending 70% of its budget on military but getting a very poor cost effectiveness and a dangerous logistical weakness.
