Edit: Particularly the fact that he is doing all of this, and is being cheered on for it, because of an “out” group (LGBTQ). Fascism redirects societies frustrations at economic conditions, and government failure into another group. So people will call them “patriots” as they dismantle the legal system that protects democracy, and not ask why their representatives aren’t doing anything to fix the issues that are truly causing their frustration. Fascism plays into nationalism and populism, but is always backed by big money. It’s their yolo. They’d rather destroy the current system, rather than concede any wealth or power to economic reform.
