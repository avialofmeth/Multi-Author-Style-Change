It could count, but 40-50 years you could light a few different rivers in the US on fire, we burned leaded gasoline, there was lead paint and/or asbestos dust in our houses and workplaces, littering wasn't given a second thought, and factories belched out whatever they wanted without oversight. And on the topic of plastics, who knows what was in them back then that we've since learned are bad for you. "BPA-free" wasn't a thing until recently. The only upside is that I don't think plastic bottles got much use until the 80s, but TupperWare has been around since the 50s.
