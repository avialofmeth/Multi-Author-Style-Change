I do not think those reps care what the best interest of the United States is. That is not why they are elected. Look at their districts, the people there do not see Russia, China, North Korea as their enemies. They see democrats as their enemies. What is best for the country doesn't matter for people in those areas, what matters is fighting democrats.
