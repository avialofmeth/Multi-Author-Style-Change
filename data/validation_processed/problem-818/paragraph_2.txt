In that case, Exxon generally didn't burn the petroleum products it extracted; it sold the vast majority of them to other entities, who actually burned them and actually generated the emissions while they were in possession of them. (Cracking does produce significant emissions, but nowhere near as much as when everything that was cracked is combusted.) Those entities, Exxon's customers, had the option not to burn what they purchased. Is it better to blame Exxon for those emissions simply because Exxon is a more conveniently identified target? Or do you really believe that it matters who took the objectionable action - as you have stated?
