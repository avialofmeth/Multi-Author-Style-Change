I've been trying to keep tabs on what various right-wing online communities have been saying this week, and there's only one spot left where I keep seeing a domination of pro-Trump messaging, and even that seems chaotic. That would be T\_D's bastard stepchild website (I won't give the URL here; it's easy to find if you're curious), which I keep checking to see what his true core is saying about this.
