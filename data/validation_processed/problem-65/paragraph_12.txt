There was one year, when almost every vehicle we opened had the same fault - the protective coating around a flexible cord all became rigid and fell apart on contact, exposing the wires inside. That turned out to be an unexpected manufacturer defect that required finding a replacement material. This was beyond my paygrade, so I don't know the exact details but I heard it was a several year project trying to find a replacement that a company was willing to commit to manufacturing small quantities of for many decades.
