If the Russian Federation collapses what will be the borders of all the new states that could form? How do you deal with people from different ethnic groups who will find themselves on the wrong side of those borders? What are the implications for all countries currently aligned with Russia? What happens to all the nuclear/chemical weapons inside of Russia? It's impossible to know the answers to some of these questions, as well as many others that would arise.
