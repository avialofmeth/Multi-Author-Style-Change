Okay. Some things to note. First off, the article argues a general decline in biking among children, but children up to middle school here already have to wear school-issued helmets when they bike to to school, and elementary school students are not allowed to bike to school at all. They walk. This law isn't going to affect younger children, because they are not the target for it.
