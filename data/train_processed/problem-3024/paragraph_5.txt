I am not opposed to items being returned. The problem I have is how do they determine who to return items to? Many First Nation tribes were wiped out. How do you determine who should get the item? The other issue I have is many of these significant culture items below to humanity and not to one group of people. As long as itâ€™s preserve for posterity does it really matter if the item is in Nairobi, London, Amsterdam, Mumbai, Rio de Janiero or Anchorage? Many of us have multi-cultural heritages.
