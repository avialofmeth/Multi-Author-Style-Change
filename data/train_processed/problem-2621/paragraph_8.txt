SCOTUS ruled spending money is speech. So investing is speech. So any law the insists what you can or cannot invest in is the government controlling speech and unconstitutional under the first amendment. Gee it's a shame Republicans on SCOTUS ruled that way years ago and now it's going to bite them in the ass. As per usual with what Republicans want.
