EDIT: To be clear, since trolls are playing bullshit gotcha games, I'm saying they should provide evidence that he previously CLAIMED this status, before the shooting. I don't care what his actual status is one way or another beyond that. If he did claim it before, fine, but if he's only claiming it now, it's probably to get out of a hate crime charge. Whatever the case may be, his actual status as non-binary or binary doesn't make him any less of a shit head and he should get the absolute max sentencing, which is at the heart of my point.
