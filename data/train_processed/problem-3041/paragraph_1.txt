Iit's not just that he threw in the word "peacefully" once, after spending two solid months whipping his supporters into a frenzy and telling them they need to "fight like hell." It's that a good lawyer (assuming Trump could find one willing to work for him) could easily establish reasonable doubt. "I'll march down to the Capitol with you" could be (the lawyer would argue) about peaceful protest. "Fight like hell" could be a metaphor for a political battle. And of course the clip with the word "peacefully" would be played repeatedly for the jury.
