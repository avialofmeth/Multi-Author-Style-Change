Back to the story, mom opted to send the thing out for repair back at Apple. So she's now spent $3600 total to purchase and then to repair a computer. Remember, it's 2003. For comparison, I had built a very good desktop PC for gaming that same year for around $750. That desktops specs were about twice as powerful as the powerbook, and it worked fine for 11 years. $2k for a computer that didn't make it 2 years was a complete rip off to begin with, and repair costs were equally bad.
