If the fines only cover the cost of fixing the issues, companies will still be incentivized to do whatever they want to people and the environment as long as they can afford the cleanup if they get caught. The penalties should be the thing that detracts them from doing shitty things. If the fines are so absurd that they can't possibly pass it on to the consumer because none of their customers would pay such high amounts for their product, then that would deter companies from breaking regulations. The only thing they care about is their bottom line and these ridiculously little penalties are just going to perpetuate this cycle.
