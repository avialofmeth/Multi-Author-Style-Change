Not that I disagree, but the number of events that are reported as extreme has increased disproportionately to the actual increase in extreme weather. Here in the Northeast it seems every year they come up with a new twist on how to make the first snowfall remarkable. It's either the earliest snow event or the biggest snowfall in December, or the coldest or whatever- pick your superlative.
