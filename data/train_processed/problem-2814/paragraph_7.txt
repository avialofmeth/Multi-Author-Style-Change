After the war in Ukraine is over, handing over these criminals could be one condition for easing the sanctions. These guys aren't worth much of anything to Russia if on the opposite end they could get hundreds of millions of Euros worth of sanctions lifted. I suppose that Russia will rather kill them and hand over the bodies than see them humiliated in the Hague but in any case these people will live in fear for the rest of their short lives. To be honest I'm surprised if they haven't already been killed years ago.
