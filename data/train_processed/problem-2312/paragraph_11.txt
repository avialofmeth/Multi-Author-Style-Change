I still can’t be sure if Lebanon’s multi-confessional parliamentary system encourages the warlord culture of Lebanese politics, or if it’s the warlord politics that encourages the multi-confessional system. Either way, this system was what helped end the civil war. But the civil war warlords have only just recently been retiring out. (Aoun is a recent example).
