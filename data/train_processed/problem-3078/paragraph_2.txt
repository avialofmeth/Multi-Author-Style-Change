The modern Russian Orthodox Church was literally created by the Soviet Union to push propaganda. They tried to destroy organized religion completely early on in the communist era. However, during WW2 they needed to find new ways to motivate their soldiers and religion does wonders when it comes to convincing men to die for a cause. Stalin installed the most compliant priest he could find as the grand patriarch and they've pretty much been tools of the government ever since then. There is no separation of church and state in Russia as the former exists solely to support the latter.
