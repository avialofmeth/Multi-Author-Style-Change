It’s stealing military technology. That isn’t as simple as IP theft. I doubt the CCP would give such generous sentences for foreigners who were caught doing the same. It might make a terrible person for saying this but depending on how much information they took the sentence should match the severity. You might disagree and that’s okay but I believe stealing technology that literally threatens the national security of my country and our partners requires a much firmer hand.
