And they are here to stay. Drones at various levels of complexity will continue to play a bigger and bigger part of modern warfare. They’re generally cheaper and more effective. There will be advances in anti-drone warfare no doubt, but we’ll see the rise of swarms of cheap suicide drones. We will also see more advanced drones, highly networked with more advanced conventional aircraft like the B-21 and F-35. There’s even the ones that we know exist but have not been officially acknowledged like the RQ-180 (the real name is unknown).
