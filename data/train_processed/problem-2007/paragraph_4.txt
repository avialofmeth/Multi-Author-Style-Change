Some good news is that while they were firing missiles at us the whole morning our forces didn’t sit idly, Russians reported that one of their S-300 launchers was destroyed by our strike right in the middle of the missile attack. There were also a bunch of other attacks on Russian positions on their side of the border, as well as another strike on Engels airbase, though I’m pretty sure this time they did actually manage to intercept our drone.
