They need to take stand against scam call centers, I've been getting a call from some BS "continuing education agency" but they aggressively wanted my full name first, DOB and social etc, I've blown them off but they've been relentlessly calling me this whole weekend and even dumb enough to leave a voice mail with the sounds of the call center in the back ground.
