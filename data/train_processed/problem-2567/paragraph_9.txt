Although the Shahed-136 is referred to as a drone, it's actually a long-range loitering munition — meaning it can fly around like a drone and linger over a target area. Once on site, these systems can be directed at specific targets, fly straight into them, and detonate upon impact — thus leading people to refer to them as suicide or kamikaze drones.
