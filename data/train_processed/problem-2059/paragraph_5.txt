What I don't quite follow is the casual overstaying of his diplomatic visa. He arrived in the US on 1 January on a visa which expires 30 days after you finish diplomatic tasks. Presumably he finished being a diplomat the moment he was no longer president of Brazil, so his visa would expire at the end of the month.
