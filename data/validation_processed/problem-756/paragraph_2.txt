You do know that in order to detonate a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb and create the temperatures and pressures necessary for fusion you have to build it inside of a fission bomb with traditional radioactive material like plutonium or uranium right? Hydrogen bombs still have radiation, though I’ll be honest I don’t know the difference in radiation levels between a straight up fission bomb or a fusion bomb detonated by fission.
