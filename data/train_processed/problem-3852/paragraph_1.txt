Hm, I think the timing is explained very easily: In light of the Trump case, someone in the Biden admin probably had the smart idea that "there is a sliver of truth to Trump's counter argument in that past presidents or VPs have taken classified documents to places they worked or lived and documentation if every single piece of these documents has been returned has not always been maintained with 100% diligence, so we better make absolutely sure that a GOP house, when kicking off dozens of weird investigations into Biden, won't find anything. So let's check every single drawer, shelf, corner immediately and get ahead of that risk".
