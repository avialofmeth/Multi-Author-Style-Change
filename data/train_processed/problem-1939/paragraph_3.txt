MA is a blue state and although Charlie Baker was a pretty reasonable centrist Republican as governor (as was Mitt Romney, in his time) Massachusetts voters generally speaking don't put up with Republican bullshit. The crazier the Republican party gets the less chance they have in a state that has, like, colleges and literacy and stuff.
