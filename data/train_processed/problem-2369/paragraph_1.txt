I get that the ACA didn't fix everything, healthcare & Cobra are still costly, and qualifying for subsidized or free coverage is onerous. But it is possible. Cobra is a costly extension of your prior coverage; in Calif go to and you can re-qualify for sliding-scale or free coverage; similar ACA plans exist in other states. 100% agreed, it needs to get much better; healthcare should be universal and independent of employers.
