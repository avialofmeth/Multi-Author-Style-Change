The USSR was a geopolitical superpower during the cold war, but collapsed. Russia's priority is not to make itself an attractive alliance partner, but relies on its abundance of land, minorities, nukes, fossil fuels and lack of ethics to run a military and civilian war and enforce their alliances. Fuck all who use violence. You can whataboutism about the blood on the hands of Western countries in the past, but each case deserves their own judge and we're now judging Russia for its violence in Ukraine.
