I mean, that might be true though depending on the upper ceiling. Statistically there will always be child abuse occurring in those types of situations. 400/1000 would be a mind numbingly serious problem. 400/10,000,000 would be a success. Obviously you want that number as close to zero as possible, but you cannot remove crime from humanity.
