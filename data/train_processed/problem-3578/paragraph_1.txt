I don’t think Americans understand just how close we go back to a live war on an almost quarterly basis. I left the Air Force not that long ago, I was on the ‘18 QRF when Kim was threatening to invade the south and use nuclear weapons. The North would often put a million troops within 3 miles of the DMZ which obviously scared the crap out of South Korea and would force the US to drum up an response force. Those chemical weapons they have are no joke. And the fact a ICBM overflew Japan is terrifying. Kim says he will strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. We should listen to dictators when they say they will do something, history tells us they actually measure up on those promises (see Putin’s remarks on invading Ukraine a year ago).
