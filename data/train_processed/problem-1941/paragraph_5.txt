Yes, he's corrupt. Castillo has been involved in protecting or enabling corruption during his term while receiving a cut for his trouble. Some critical cases are related to his family (his nephews Fray Vásquez Castillo and Gian Marco Castillo Gómez) and members of his own cabinet (ministers Juan Silva and Geiner Alvarado). Colaborators already declared to the Prosecutor's Office that Castillo knew all this. The evidence kept accumulating so much that Castillo feared it finally convinced enough congressmen to vote in favor of an impeachment, so he autocouped himself in order to concentrate power and prevent the loss of immunity.
