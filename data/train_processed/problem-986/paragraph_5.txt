But the interesting implication of this bill, assuming you're relaying the information correctly, that it would prohibit teachers from using a student's preferred gender pronouns without parental consent, is that the teacher would be prohibited from referring to Bob, a cisgender male, as "he/him" without parental consent. And likewise, prohibited from referring to Jane, a cis female, as "she/her." So the teacher would either be required to use names only, or to use non-preferred pronouns.
