Correct. The Dems, not being idiots, knew that the IRS is requires by their own regs to conduct a mandatory audit of POTUS’s taxes, so once Trump had completed his first year they asked Treasury: “Hey, are you actually auditing Trump’s taxes like you are required to do?” and when they didn’t get a response, they used that as the basis for their lawsuit and it turns out that was the reason why they got access to his taxes. Another own goal by Trump.
