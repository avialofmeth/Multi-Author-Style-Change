Switzerland’s “armed neutrality” was openly hostile towards the third reich. It was all they could do to maintain their territorial integrity surrounded by axis powers. Spain had just had an utterly devastating civil war (though that doesn’t excuse their nazi sympathies - Franco was a real piece of shit) and Winston Churchill commented of Sweden that they “ignored the moral issues of the war and played both sides for profit”. I think my comment holds up.
