Now, is what the Chinese did a war crime? We don't know. Unless we find out that they used a laser weapon that was designed to cause blindness, or that their goal was to blind the Filipinos, we won't know, since they are going to admit anything. Until we learn more, it's just a shitty act of aggression.
