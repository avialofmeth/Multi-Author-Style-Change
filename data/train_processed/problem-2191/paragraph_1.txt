Yeah, I was tracking Tim Ryan, but it's not as surprising. Thought his ohio boy image would be competitive. But Ron Johnson in WI? Come on. I know a lot of WI is rural, just thought Madison and Milwaukee would come through. I know he's an an incumbent, but his campaign and debate performance was horrible. Oh well. You can tell many people don't watch it from the views.
