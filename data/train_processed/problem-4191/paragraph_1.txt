I won't say people who can't separate the art from the artist are wrong, but I will say that I believe that there are a lot of genuinely beautiful things in the world that exist in spite of the horrible people who brought them into being, and there's something almost vindictively pleasing about taking that from them. As if they're the mar on their greatest works, and that their work will always be remembered with the stain of their existence on it, like if the Mona Lisa smelled faintly of shit for all eternity.
