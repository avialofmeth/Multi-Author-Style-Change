I bought a couple diesel engines for dirt cheap from him, because he wanted dollars to buy some cases of CA glue to take back home. Those engines were incredible. The castings looked like shit: rough flashing edges and a dull finish, but when I took them apart their cylinders and pistons were perfectly honed. The bearings were excellent. They ran really nice and they cold started well.
