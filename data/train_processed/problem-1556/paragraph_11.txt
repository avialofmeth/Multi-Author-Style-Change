If I had to guess it seems like the US would be the most likely suspect. Frankly after Biden said we had the capability I just assumed most people thought we did it. And I didn't understand why that even was a controversial position. Attacking Ukraine and then the largest western military not blowing up your pipeline seems like a bad strategy.
