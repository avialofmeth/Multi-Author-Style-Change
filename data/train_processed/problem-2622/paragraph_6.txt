Don't care whether or not they're egotistical assholes. I'd be happy hearing less about the wholesome celebrities too. I'd have more time and energy for all the wholesome people I know in real life. And also I don't trust the public perception of anybody who has a PR team. And also I'd like people to think for themselves more and stop appealing to celebrities to justify their beliefs and lifestyles.
