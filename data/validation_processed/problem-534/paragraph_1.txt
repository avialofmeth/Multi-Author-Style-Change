this is stupid and dangerous. you can one social media app, you set the precedent for others. and if US lawmakers are sooooo concerned with the privacy of Americans being violated, they would ban the entire internet, since everything everywhere here is constantly surveilling and stealing our data. remember Cambridge Analytica and all it did in britain and the US? where was the legislation to ban facebook? this is a horrible bill and a horrible idea. let's not forget calls to ban this are mostly coming from the Right here, who are still mad tiktok teens used it to troll the former president.
