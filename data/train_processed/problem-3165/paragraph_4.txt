Conversely it's pretty easy to point to what the Russian interference in the 2016 election was. They set up spam internet camps in places like Belarus and Thailand, paying people to propagate fake news and misinformation. There have been massive FB pages with millions of followers that have been outed as set up to do this. Even if US intelligence is somehow amplifying the calls on Chinese social media, which is probably impossible given that they are a locked down system unlike Western platforms with harsh government control of moderation, that is completely different from the analogy you are trying to make.
