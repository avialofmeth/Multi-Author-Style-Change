I might need to watch the video again, it was hard to tell whether there were any cuts to it. It looked like it cut forward a few moments to show the point the Russian soldier appearing and taking shots. So i got a slightly different impression based off how the continuity came across. So in that case I may have interpreted incorrectly.
