I'm not a fan of IPs and NDAs. If you have to prevent competition in order to stay in business then there is something wrong with your business. I also remember how problematic NDAs were for professional programmers trying to teach basic programming skills at a hobbyist group. As a teen at the time, the professionals really wanted me to take over teaching the group to help reduce the risk of them losing their jobs, getting sued, and having to pay their employers for breach of contract. I could see how torn they were by the joy and desire to teach their craft to other interested people and the fear of the repercussions of slipping up.
