No one is completely responsible for what your ancestors did…. But it sure as hell is a _choice_ to make up shit to make it seem like they weren’t responsible for what they did either. And while you’re not responsible, it sure is a dick move to pretend like it’s not the right thing to do to try to do reasonable things for the people harmed.
