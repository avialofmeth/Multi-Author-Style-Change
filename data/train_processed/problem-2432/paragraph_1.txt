Easy buddy, he does have the power to fix this. He just doesnt have the will. First off, he fine Norfolk Southern into oblivion and make them pay for everything they have destroyed. But he won't because he doesn't want to. He probably will end up making them repay some of the costs associated with cleaning up the areas they blanketed with volatile toxin, he has no choice, people are angry. But it will be a slap on the wrist for the company. If he really did want to stop this from ever happening again, he doesnt need congress at all, he has more than enough authority as the SOT.
