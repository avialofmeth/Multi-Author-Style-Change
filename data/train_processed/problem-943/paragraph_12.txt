I agree a bit. But I grew up around people who identified as Republicans. They were always vile people. Trump made it ok for them to be loud and proud about their hate and ignorance. These people didn’t just pop up over night, They’ve always been here. And now the children of these parents, nieces of uncles, nephews of uncles, and grandchildren of grandparents have collectively said the same thing. Republican vs. Democrat is very much about old, racist religious fanatics vs. young, progressive, agnostics. And wait until 2023, when Republicans realize how much more ground they’re going to lose. And I’m sure they’re planning more violence. I’ll have absolutely no compunction about turning over a relative in a J6-kind of crime.
