That's overly prescriptive. I don't doubt the findings you commented about, but we have no information to suggest this is the leading cause, only cause, or even a majority cause. Work like the study OP posted is important to help us understand what the real problem is. However I think we can both agree we should have started acting as soon as we understood it to be an issue, regardless of how big of a slice of the total pie it makes up.
