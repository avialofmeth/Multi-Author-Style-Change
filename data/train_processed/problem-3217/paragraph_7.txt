I wouldnâ€™t say Bakhmut falling is a given, like I said before they are on the very outer edge of the city, and they would still need to go through the very heart of it. On top of that Ukraine has been making some small moves in Luhansk Oblast again and will force Russia to answer there eventually. On top of that there is talk of Ukraine making a move south soon as well.
