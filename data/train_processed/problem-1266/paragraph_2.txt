Hungary wasn't really a massive kingdom since the middle ages. If we are talking later than that they weren't either. Hungary was always the Austro-hungarian equivalent to what Belarus or Ukraine was in the USSR. If the UK, Austria, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy can get over losing their former glory, so can Hungary. Atleast they have regained their independence, lol...
