Schröder has been close to Putin while chancellor yes but frankly at this point he is irrelevant seeing as he is nearly 20 years out of office. Excluding someone out of a party is for very good reason against German law and requires actually comitting a crime. While Schröder is and was unpopular, he is no criminal.
