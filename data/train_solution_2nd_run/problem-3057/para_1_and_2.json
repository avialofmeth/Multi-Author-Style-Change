  "feature4": {
    "explanation": "Paragraph 1 maintains a professional and informative tone, emphasizing rules and guidelines. In contrast, Paragraph 2 conveys a confrontational and accusatory tone, using informal expressions like 'still in denial?' These differing narrative styles suggest different authors.",
