Maybe from an outside perspective. Within the US, the BIRA (lol?) flushed Obama-era projects with money. Notable winners are California's high speed rail project, Chicago's Metra, Amtrak, and Virginia. Biden's decades-long plan to expand Amtrak's eastern corridor with a Southeast Corridor from DC to Charlotte is now formally happening and is no longer opposed by Republicans. Biden is rebuilding our nuclear capacity, and by the end of the decade we'll have the ability to build and fuel nuclear reactors without Russia. Same for space rockets.
