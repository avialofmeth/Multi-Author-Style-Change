Every time I follow a link to Twitter it's nothing but a cess pool. I'm not LGBTQ+ and I just don't care how people conduct themselves as long as they're not harming others. I can't imagine getting so mad about this that you show up and yell at strangers. No one has ever demonstrated how a person reading a book to a child hurts them. It just makes me think these protesters are the actual pedos / self-loathers. They hate that aspect of themselves but take it out on others. Admitting they have unresolved issues is too painful.
