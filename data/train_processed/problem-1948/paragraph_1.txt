It does extend somewhat to general speech. However freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences. Socially nor legally. Try yelling fire in a movie theatre, or yell bomb at an airport. These are examples of trying to create panic and is punishable by law. So is conspiracy, "il pay you x money if you murder so and so". You didnt pull the trigger but freedom of speech doesnt protect conspiracy to commit murder charges.
