Okay. What the fuck is going on? Reddit is full of posts referencing the Republican chaos around the Speaker elections, and one of the top comments under each post seems to use the word “delicious”. Who the hell describes things like this as “delicious“? Do these comments all originate from one troll farm that somehow got it in its head that Americans use the word delicious in this context? We don’t. Every single post has a top comment using the word “delicious”. This seems way beyond chance. Something weird is going on.
