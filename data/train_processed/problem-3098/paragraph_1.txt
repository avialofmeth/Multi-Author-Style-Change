After the joke of a response when taking Crimea from world leaders, there is no room to not be an unmovable wall to any Russian threats (or actions). Those weapons are horrific, the thought of someone believing that using one for any reason ...blows every rational neuron in my brain. But it is more dangerous at thia point not to see this through. They let Russia bark and take, bark and take...we have been through this before. Stop the wannabe hitler now before someone decides to join his side and start WWW3...(and you dont count Belurus, your dictator and any of his piss ants dont rate enough to count t for an alliance.).
