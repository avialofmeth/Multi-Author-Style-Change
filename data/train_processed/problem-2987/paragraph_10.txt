Wind farms would be especially great at making power if we put them on mountains, the same ones coal farms are stripping, but then you have to connect the power source, and they have to be maintained. These are all part of the logistics of getting a green energy grid. Nuclear energy may still be a ways off from building new plants, but also offer a way to produce power in areas that aren’t great for either solar or wind. It’s important to remember that power traveling through a line loses energy, so the power generation would have to happen across the US.
