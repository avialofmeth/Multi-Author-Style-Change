Her political theatrics were cringey (kente cloth taking a knee for example), and her position on investment rules for house members were not great. BUT her political prowess was unmatched. When she passed the ACA, she knew that vote would probably cost a lot of moderate democrats their seats, but she got them to do it. As fractious as the democratic coalition was, she got them to stick together when it mattered to pass major legislation. The Democratic Party needs fresh faces, but damn was it a sigh of relief that Nancy had the wheel in the Trump years.
