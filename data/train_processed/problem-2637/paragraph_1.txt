- The Japanese general was instrumental in the victory of Guninou. Nemoto was originally the commander of Japanese forces in Mongolia during WWII. When Japan surrendered, Nemoto received the help of Chiang Kai-shek in ensuring the safe return of the troops under his command, and he later sneaked out of Japan (which was under lock-down by the GHQ) to Taiwan to meet Chiang and to help in the defense of Kinmen. He told his family that he was going fishing and left home with a fishing rod. After the battle at Kinmen, he returned with his fishing rod and never talked about his role in the battle. His participation was kept secret by Taiwan until around 2011 when the descendants of Nemoto wanted to retrace his path, eventually leading to a semi-official recognition of Nemoto's contribution in the battle. A Japanese TV station made a documentary of the process.
