Short answer is no. China is China today exactly because of the ironfisted ruling for sooo many decades. To keep >a billion people in check for so many years is no simple feat. Of cos one cannot say never say never but the CCCP will almost always certainly come up tops because they control everything within China and especially now with the entire nation monitored, it will be even harder for the people to revolt in full force. The only hope is that Xi will for some miracle decide to reverse the zero covid mandate.
