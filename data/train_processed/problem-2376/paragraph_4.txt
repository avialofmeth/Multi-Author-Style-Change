They don't care. The argument has no merit, but that's irrelevant to them: it gets the issue before a very friendly judge (that they deliberately shopped around for), who will likely rule in their favor, and any appeal will go to the same Supreme Court that bent over backwards to "justify" the entire reason that they were installed there and overturned Roe.
