Even a few decades ago, there would be senators on both sides of the aisle that would approve of the opposing party’s nominee, not anymore. I blame this solely on the Republican Party, and I will die on that hill. Their pure pursuit of power has been proven somewhat effective but does absolutely nothing for their constituents, and they do not care. Just keep blaming “the other” for their woes and do nothing to help them, except corporate donors of course.
