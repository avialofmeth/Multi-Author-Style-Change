We experienced an elderly family member who chose to pass on their own terms via the MAID program. There are many misconceptions about how it works. It took multiple months of interviews and assessments with physicians, counselors, and nurses before approval. Canadians are not going to just walk into a MAID clinic, fill out some paperwork and die. Depending on circumstances it can be the most beautiful, dignified way a loved one can pass.
