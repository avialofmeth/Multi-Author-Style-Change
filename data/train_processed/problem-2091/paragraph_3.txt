Bakhmut isn't even that strategically important for Russia anymore. It was in integral city for Russia to control before the Lyman counteroffensive because it kept Russia from advancing toward Sloviansk from the south. Once Russia lost the areas around Lyman, Bakhmut should have been relegated to a second tier front but instead they doubled down, throwing wave after wave of infantry at an area of the front that has probably as many lines of defense as the static area along the Donetsk border. Perhaps it's a case of having lost so much in their attacks that they can't stop now or else it would all have been for nothing.
