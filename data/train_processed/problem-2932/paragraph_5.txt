Honey, I'm a US citizen. Men always seem so shocked. But, it's often on the news. And we all know not to pull over without going to a well lit area, blah blah. But for these young girls in Iran there's been a very emotional response from us, and this is why. They aren't just going to execute those girls who protest. It's way to terrorize the other girls into silence and compliance. Unfortunately I'm not surprised at all. Heartbroken but not surprised.
