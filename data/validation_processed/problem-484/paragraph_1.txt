It's astonishing. Most hypocrites at least try to sound reasonable, even when the reason is bullshit. Like when mcconnell said it was okay to block Obama's SC nomination because it was an election year, but when he wanted to push through barrett he said "oh it's different when the presidency and senate are controlled by the same party". He knows it's bullshit, we know it's bullshit. But at least there's a flimsy reasoning. This guy just blatantly says "i can do this but you can't" or "what i did was not a crime, but she did the same thing and she needs to be punished for it.".
