1) Russia wanted to catapult itself back to Superpower Status by breaking up NATO and the EU. Think about it, Trump openly questioned why the US was in NATO along with the French. The EU was seriously damaged by Brexit. All that needed to happen was Russia to threaten NATO and the US to fail to respond. French called for an independent European Army either rip NATO apart or the Eastern edge of the EU glue themselves so closely to NATO that it rips the EU apart. A quick win and annexation would also shatter the idea that the US is global hegemon and reinforce the concept that powerful nations (like Russia and China) can/should have spheres of influence to "protect their legitimate interests" that no foreign power (like the US or EU) can't get involved in. A Cold War/Age of Empires set up would put Russia back on top again.
