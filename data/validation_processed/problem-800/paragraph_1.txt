I mean with the amount of bullshit flying around here about us, what do you expect? Even most people that aren't from germany have by now gotten the hint that the narrative "Merkel singlehandedly caused Putin to invade and now Germany does nothing because theyre all secretly on russias side" is utter bullshit, so the occasional troll gets downvoted.
