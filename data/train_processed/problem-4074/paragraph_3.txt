Did you know that one of the biggest rules of Greek drama was that death couldn't happen on-stage? So when, for example, Agamemnon got shanked by Clytemnestra and her lover, he would be off-stage and his lines had him shouting something to the effect of "Ack I am stabbed Agh, twice, I am stabbed again Now I die" It is rather silly to read.
