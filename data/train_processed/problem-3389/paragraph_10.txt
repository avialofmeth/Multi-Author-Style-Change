There was always ethnic tension. Or did you forget about the Chetniks in Serbia who felt betrayed and in the end brought the end of Yugoslavia. Or maybe the Ustasa who hated Serb and Bosnian alike because they wanted to create a greater Croatia. Tito had managed to keep the country in one piece because he knew how to compromise and satisfy all the parts.
