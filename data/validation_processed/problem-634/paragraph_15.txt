Great ratings and clicks do not equal votes. Fox News doing an offensive segment on women who don't want to have children; or Matt Gaetz tweeting about fat women might get eyes and rage points... but if you are trying to win elections it's poison. Childless overweight women just might still want low taxes; but when you wrap your party brand in hate you aren't winning any new voters.
