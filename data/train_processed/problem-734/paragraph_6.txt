Well, sort of. There are a lot of misconceptions about alfalfa. A lot of articles like to paint alfalfa as "water thirsty" and cite stats on water usage per acre per year. But what they fail to take into account is that in places with long growing seasons like AZ and CA, they're typically getting 8 to 10 cuts (harvests) per year. Alfalfa itself has a very deep taproot, over 20 feet in many cases, and is actually quite drought tolerant. It's just that with the right soil moisture it grows very quickly and you can maximize yield by irrigating.
