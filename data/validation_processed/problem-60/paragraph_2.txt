I think this is standard operating procedure. Deny deny Denys and then deny some more. Even Murica does this.. according to the McNamara doctrine The funny thing is that they want public credit, based on this article, which is counterintuitive, given the fact that in military circles it’s undeniable . But since their drones are used by NGO’s maybe they want commercial clients with this horn tooting exercise. I would definitely consider their tech, it’s as close to sn open source drone we will get.(I remember reading that it has car parts and washing machine tech and the engines can be mounted in tandem).
