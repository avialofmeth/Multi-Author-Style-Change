They know the shit they propose isn't going to pass, it's all optics like most Republican bullshit. I doubt after the abortion fiasco they actually want to pass anything but they will put forward all sorts of bills for propaganda purposes and blame Biden for not passing them. All they care about is obstructing government and blocking tax reform, it's what they were paid off to do.
