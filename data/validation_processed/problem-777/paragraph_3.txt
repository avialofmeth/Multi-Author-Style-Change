I think a lot of people, like me, assumed from the title that Israel wants to annex or invade part of Jordan. And given that most of this area is already controlled by Israeli forces and has a majority jewish population I don't see it causing a civil war either. Of course this is ignoring all the morality and ethics of the situation this is just a pragmatic view of it.
