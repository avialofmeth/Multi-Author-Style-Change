What makes you think that the NHS chose your option. It does not say that they did it at the expense of helping the many. It also states that the NHS worked out a substantial discount on the meds so it could be used for other kids like the one mentioned. The deal is the NHS is not US medical care. It serves ALL their people, not just the rich or those who can afford it. This was not done at the expense of the many.
