Fuck that. This isn’t about hijab. It’s about women being beaten to death for breaking a ‘morality’ law. It’s about women (and men) being arrested and raped, beaten, whipped, shocked, tortured so badly they need medical care and being denied that. It’s about having a 10 minute trial, without a lawyer and being sentenced to death by hanging. It’s about them being lifted by a crane so that they slowly (20-30 minutes) suffocate to death. It’s about their tortured and murdered bodies being buried in secret or held for ransom by the police. It’s about families being threatened with the safety of the family if they say how how a family member was killed/died.
