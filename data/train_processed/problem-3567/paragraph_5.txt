Iâ€™m from Ireland and the catholic church had an enormous influence on government decisions, policies and legislation here until the early to mid 90s when the church rightly, and thankfully, lost much of its influence on the government. Religion is weaning here, again, thankfully. All religions are basically cults. They make parents bring their kids so they can indoctrinate them from a young age before they can question anything, and even if they do the parents will put them back in their place and tell them not to question this bat shit crazy nonsense.
