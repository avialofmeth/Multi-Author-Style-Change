One user jumped in and asked him about Sam Bankman-Fried's donations to Democrats, which I presume Hunter has no clue about. The host removed the person asking the idiotic question and Hunter continued to speak. Then Hunter's connection went out or a glitch with Twitter Spaces likely kicked him out. It's possible he left, but likely not the case.
