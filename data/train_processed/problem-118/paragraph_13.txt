All I know is what’s publicly available information right now. Yes, it’s possible something is being covered up here. But why apply that to Biden and not Trump? Maybe Trump was trying not to return the documents because they contain information about all the porn star’s abortions he’s paid for. Anything’s possible right? But running wild with conspiracy theories doesn’t actually help with assessing anything, because it’s all conjecture and ultimately pointless.
