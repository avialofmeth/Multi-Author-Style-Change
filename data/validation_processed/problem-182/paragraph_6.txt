What If the world ran on how much ever work u/Average_N_Mediocre put in each day? And what if he didn't want to work 24 hours a day? But what if his work was necessary to keep children from dying, all over the world? What if he has ALREADY MONOPOLIZED THE ENTIRE WORLD OUTPUT OF u/Average_N_OK?? What then?? We cant be asked to live our lives without his saccupping, can we? That dirty monopolist.
