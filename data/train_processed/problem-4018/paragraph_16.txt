I'm not being an alarmist at all. I used a basic example that anyone could understand to speak to centralization vs decentralization, and the fact that you jumped to criticizing me, after accusing people of not being open to discussion, is super hypocritical since its apparent you're not actually open to discussion yourself. We'll agree to disagree on this and leave it at that.
