Also, he was disliked due to the fact he was making claims about election interference all the way back in 2010 about MPs without a scrap of proof, just a simple "trust me bro". He was slammed back then for making claims without providing evidence and now he wants to cast even more doubt on our elections and ask for evidence provided publicly which he knows can't be done. If he couldn't provide evidence back then to back up his claims, why is it important to do now that hes not in charge of it?
