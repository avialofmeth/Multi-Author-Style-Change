Historically republicans are following the nazi playbook to a T. Nazi didnâ€™t start of killing everyone.. they started blaming a minority group (trans/lgbtq are there current targets). Demonizing people, who for the most part have very little effect on your actual life but signaling them as the source of your problems.
