Got it down to 2k on a single loan (paid down loans one at a time, didn't consolidate) before eventually moving out, then a little under that when they were frozen. It's definitely possible to get it done, and I don't need forgiveness to be ok financially, but I didn't do it without sacrifices to my quality of life.
