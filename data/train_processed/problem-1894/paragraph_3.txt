It’s ok to not agree with my analysis, and it’s ok to proffer your own, which you have declined based on your assertion that I’m somehow prohibited. Firstly I was prohibited by amateurism, now you’re claiming unprofessionalism. If your inference of a ‘gold standard’ is a reference to an ethical code, I assure you, I’ve contravened none, quite the opposite in fact. Further, I don’t need your permission to post to Reddit.
