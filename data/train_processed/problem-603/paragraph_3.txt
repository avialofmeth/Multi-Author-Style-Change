I suspected as much though it wasn’t hard to figure out. Anyway as someone who’s not too in tune with Israeli and Iranian relations other than surface level stuff, can someone explain how Israel is able to do this without repercussions. I would imaging drone striking another country is a pretty brazen violation of sovereignty. Is it the case that everyone knows it’s Israel but it’s not official that gives Israel enough plausible deniability to not have any consequences,idk. Maybe someone more informed on the matter can explain.
