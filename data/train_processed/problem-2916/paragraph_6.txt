it's weird how so many of "those people" come crawling out of the woodwork espousing their in-depth, scholarly background on niche issues with certain topics. Covid? Suddenly everyone is an epidemiologist. Trans issues? Suddenly everyone is a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist. Abortion? Everyone's suddenly an obstetrician.
