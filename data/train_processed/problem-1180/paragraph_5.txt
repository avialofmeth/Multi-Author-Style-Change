second would be personal vendetta from putin. he despises the west. he knows dying is a possibility. he doesn't want russia to turn 180Â° the moment he dies. russia would be pumping germany/europe with gas again. with pipelines gone russia has to start at below zero to trade with europe (below zero because reparations to ukraine would be on the table while negotiating for gas). if a perfectly fine pipeline was already in place there'd be some reperation-sheninangs via cheap gas and things would be like before. but putin doesn't want things to be like before. he wants the west to be weakened. he wants some kind of new world order no matter what.
