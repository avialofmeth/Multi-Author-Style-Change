This article was what made me finally realize that GOP voters are genuinely evil, not misguided, and that good faith bipartisanship with them was not just impossible but indefensible. And the knowledge that they only understand violence, and therefore can only be defeated with violence, left me with the grim conclusion that the days of the US as we know it are numbered. I will not be surprised if there is civil war or even balkanization in our near future. Left and right wing ideologies are incompatible so long as they can't even agree on something as basic as human rights, and the moderate majority that care more about personal stability than societal progress are part of the problem.
