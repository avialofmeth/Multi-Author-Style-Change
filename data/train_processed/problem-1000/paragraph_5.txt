And to say he graduated from prestigious elite schools (HEC & ENA) and used to be the vice-president of the National Front from 2012 to 2017, appearing everywhere on political TV sets during Hollande's Presidency until Le Pen's 2017 campaign. Now he's become a noxious Twitter fury and many of his tweets tread a thin line between dumb anti-everythingness and a denunciation of globalism/the hell of EU supranationalism/Bill Gates/whatever. He got 4.62% of votes during the latest parliamentary election in his own constituency in North-Eastern France, so rest assured he's slid into irrelevance and become nothing more than a background nuisance now. Hope it's the same with Baudet...
