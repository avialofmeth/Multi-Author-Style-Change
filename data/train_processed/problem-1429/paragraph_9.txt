Russia is activly working against many democracies around the world in the political sphere. Much less how they work against our interests for years in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq. But moreso bc Putin is actively trying to pull NATO into the Ukraine conflict for legitimacy of his war, claim is we are threatening Russia from the start.... also how Putin says it himself, he is trying to start a new world order with Russia at the top. I could go on but this should summarize a lot of it.
