Nah I don't quite get what you're driving at but I remember the revolution well and that was central to the 2014 gas crisis. Hunter Biden started working for Burisma in 2014. There's a lotta domestic US BS politics at play with Burisma. Hunter is currently being investigated by the House but that could be domestic US politics too. It's hard to pin things down. Care to share some thoughts as to what you're driving at?
