There's two conflicting statements from Russian journalists -- one, supported by the prisoner's own statements in the video before his murder, is that he was kidnapped in Kyiv and sent back to his unit by Russian sympathizers. I don't see why he'd lie about that since he knew he was about to be murdered regardless of what words came out of his mouth.
