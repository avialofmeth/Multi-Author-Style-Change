<Canadian POV> I live in a downtown area that is not without people OD-ing. So.. like most cities in 2023. I walked into my local Safeway Pharmacy (at the back of a grocery store) a few weeks back and asked if they had any of those Narcan OD kits. The Pharmacist asked how many I wanted. I said "two", one for me to have and one to give away. She gave me three. She told me to give the 3rd to someone else. There was no charge. Will I ever use it? I suspect not. But if I do need it to help someone, I have it. It lasts a couple years before expiring.
