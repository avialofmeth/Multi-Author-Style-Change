Many of the... less bombastic conservatives, I occasionally have to spend time with, aren't the frothing zealot type. They understand that republican policies, and optics, tend to be good for corporations, which increases their portfolios. Short sighted imo, and lacking empathy, but at least it makes a sort of sense. They still happily watch their fellow humans suffer, and fully allow it to happen, so they can have "more", but they don't really care about civil rights or abortion or guns or what have you. They lump those into a platform, but the real motivation is always money.
