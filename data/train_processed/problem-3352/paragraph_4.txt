Youâ€™re kidding right? Most of the products on the European market are American. Ford, GM, Jeep, and others have Hugh markets in Europe. P&G owns the consumer market not to mention all the tech is American. The only thing EU protects is farming and for good reason but we still import a lot more American farm products than we ship to the US.
