Florian Philippot is fortunately a 100% irrelevant politician as of 2022. He left / was pushed out of the National Front after the 2017 elections and then founded his own party Les Patriotes which advocates leaving the European Union, the Schengen agreements, the European Convention on Human Rights and NATO, and he's become a covid antivaxxer shamelessly spouting fake news and nonsense pandering to conspiracy-minded people from day 1 since the beginning of the pandemic.
