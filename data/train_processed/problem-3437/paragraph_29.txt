Because he found presenting himself as the antipole of Putin garnered him more support. It is a political decision. But considering his long history as a Nationalist, and continued support of deportation of aliens etc, I doubt he has made a ideological 180. Keeping the quiet part silent is not the same as supporting the opposite. And his carefully prepared statement on Crimea in the OP reflects that. The "support for a referendum" when parts of the autochthone population were deported, when the current population there relies on specifically Russian tourism and Putin spent a lot of money on integrating the peninsula into Russian infrastructure stack the deck very well, and post facto stack the deck for "staying" when such a position should never be legitimized and the whole purpose of the "referendum" rests on that fact. It is annexation with extra steps, switching to a soft power tactic over the hard power opening move. Doesn't make it legitimate.
