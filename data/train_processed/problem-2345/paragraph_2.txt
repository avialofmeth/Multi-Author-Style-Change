The Trump administration certified Iran's compliance twice in 2017 before pulling out in May of 2018. Even as late as 2019 after the US withdrawal the IAEA certified compliance. You can make up whatever BS story you like, but it doesn't change the facts. At this point it seems over and done with. However I'm pretty sure the US public will not go in on another middle east war so there aren't a lot of options.
