I wouldn’t be surprised if things weren’t intentionally being muddied and lots of propaganda being thrown around so the people can’t coordinate what exactly it is that they want. The world is on edge everywhere and people have grown tired of corruption and lies from all of the elite everywhere. If they don’t try to get us to argue each other then the global unrest is going to come hard and fast. It’s not just a Peruvian problem it’s a world problem.
