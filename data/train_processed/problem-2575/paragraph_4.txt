I will admit the tax charges being evenly round is weird but also not necessarily fraudulent either… if one desired perfectly even interest rate payments like that .. one could use that as the starting place and then back into loan terms that get them there. Now if that’s the case we’d probably want to dig deeper into why those specifics were designed the way they were….
