The new regime was so openly brutal that the US quickly withdrew support and made them step aside in 1994 so Aristide can finish his term. Clinton explicitly promised to restore Aristide during his campaign and he sent troops to Haiti as a part of a UN mission to restore Aristide. It was called Operation Uphold Democracy and it came with the threat that either the coup leaders resign willingly or Haiti gets invaded. Aristide was brought back and in 1995 he disbanded the entire Haitian Armed Forces, citing Haiti's persistent history of coups.
