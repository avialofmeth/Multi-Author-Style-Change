To put that in perspective, I trained with LAV's, and the basic course at Combat School was three months. That course is the first of three, though training never really ends. There's training to use the vehicle. Training to use it in a unit of others. Training to use it in combined arms with Infantry and Artillary...the list goes on. Basically, the Ukrainians are cramming all that into one course and then going to war.
