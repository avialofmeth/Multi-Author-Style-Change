I took a geology class and what they said is fairly accurate to what I was taught. Basically pressure builds over time if it isn't released you get bigger earthquakes. Earthquakes shift the pressure elsewhere in the fault causing potentially more earthquakes. There is a bit more to how it works going into plate tectonics but that is the simple version.
