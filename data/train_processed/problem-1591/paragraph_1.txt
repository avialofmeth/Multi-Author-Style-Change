Oh no We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news ......groundhogs day has been cancelled. It seems that nobody ever asked Phil how he felts about his famous role in forecasting, and in fact he has been held captive and made to appear each February 2nd . Groundhogs everywhere are very upset that they have been duped and stereotyped. It's not right to be used as an image to represent something as foreign and offensive as the forecast.
