It would have been a Blue Wave if it wasn’t for Republican Gerrymandering. The numbers are so skewed because of this. How can a third of the country (alt.Right), represent half of the electorate?? This is the kind of stuff the younger generations Z will destroy and abolish IF the Boomer Alt Right don’t deconstruct our democracy to the point of violence and civil war before that happens.
