I rented a Tesla in the UK and did a road trip from Cheshire to the Isle of Skye, which ended up taking about 12 hours due to traffic and having to stop. There are ways of making it work pretty much anywhere. When I arrived at the AirBnb I charged using a standard household outdoor socked the owner used for plugging his lawnmower in and gave him some money for the electricity. It worked fantastically well.
