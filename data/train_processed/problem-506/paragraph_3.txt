But when sudden reality check rolled it, what do we have? Planes and cars, even nationally made, critically depend on exported parts. Production of arctic mining tech and LNG tankers is impossible without foreign technology. Semiconductor industry is still decades behind bare minimum, not even talking about actual competition with Asian or American manufacturers. Fuck it, even building trains requires parts that cannot be produced in Russia. This is humiliating!
