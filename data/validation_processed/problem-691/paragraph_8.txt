I shoot one elk a year up in Oregon. I hunt duck for 100 days in the winter, I take one hog, I take two or three turkeys, I fish as many salmon and halibut as I can in their seasons. Sometimes I buy chicken just for a change of pace, but it's genuinely been about four years since I had to support what I consider to be a largely inhumane and unclean meat industry.
