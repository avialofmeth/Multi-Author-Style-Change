Those SMRs aren't even expected to come online before the end of the decade. We can't really consider SMRs to be viable competitors to solar and wind before they're even on the market, or even putting energy onto the grid yet. It certainly wouldn't be wise to forego solar and wind investment now on the assumption that SMRs will succeed at some point in the future.
