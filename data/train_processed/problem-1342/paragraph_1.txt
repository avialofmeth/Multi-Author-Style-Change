Almost certainly the original plan was a weekend war. Steamroll Kyiv in 4 or 5 days, remove the "Nazis" and put some pro-Russian puppets in power, wait a month or two, have them run a "totally fair and in no way rigged" referendum about allowing the country to be annexed by great and glorious mother Russia, then absorb the country, and all the income generated by it's oilfields, farmland, and Black Sea ports. Basically the same playbook the used in Crimea and South Ossetia in Georgia over the last decade writ large.
