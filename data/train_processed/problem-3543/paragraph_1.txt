Let’s not pretend that the Kurdish people are a monolithic group. We unfortunately sold out the Syrian Kurdish dominated SDF to appease Turkey/Erdogan and partially to protect Trumps business relationships in Turkey. We won’t sell out Iraqi Kurds in Erbil to appease Iran; the US has been waiting for an excuse to retaliate against Iran. We’ve got no reason to appease the Iranian regime and we actively are supporting/amplifying protests there. I don’t think I’m wrong here.
