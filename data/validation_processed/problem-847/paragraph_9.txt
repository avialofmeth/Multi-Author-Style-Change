I mean I can’t afford a house. I probably can barely afford to heat my rental basement suite. I have already cut back my meat consumption about 75% 90% now is chicken while the other 10 is locally sourced from a small scale ranch I have connection to. I work from home, I cook my own food, don’t consume much processed food, recycle, compost etc.
