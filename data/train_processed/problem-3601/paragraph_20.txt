... where did I state that Israel is illegitimate? I didn't, nice strawman though. Also no, there is no state of Palestine. As for the name Palestine, that was given to the region back during the 5th century BCE by Greek historian Herodotus, meaning the land of Philistines when translated. Prior to UN Resolution 181 the Brits had controlled the territory since WWI and referred to it as the Mandate of Palestine. Prior to that the Ottoman Empire controlled it and was still referred to as Palestine.
