The growth of our national deficit under Trump ranks as the third-biggest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any US President in American history per the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And unlike George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw larger increases in deficits, Trump did not launch two foreign conflicts or have to pay for a civil war. No, Trump just spent into oblivion and cut corporate taxes for the rich.
