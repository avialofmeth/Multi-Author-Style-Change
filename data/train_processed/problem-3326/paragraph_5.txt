Next protests will be illegal, freedom of speech further limited than it already is, curfews will be enforced and vilification of people fighting for basic human rights. What is this country turning into? It maybe an unpopular opinion but I believe we need a general election rapidly, I also believe a Brexit referendum would be beneficial Once again the British public has been had, lied to and hoodwinked about the issues that concern us the most. Now things are going awry, the government will blame the people. Welcome to the dark ages again.
