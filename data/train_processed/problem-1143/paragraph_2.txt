This war has be double-Christmas in July for the military industrial complex in the USA. They've been getting to try out all their latest weapon systems in a war against a peer-level adversary. (Though Russia hasn't given nearly as good a showing as we would have expected in 2021.) I judge this for many reasons, not the least of which I keep getting contacts from various defense industry recruiters.
