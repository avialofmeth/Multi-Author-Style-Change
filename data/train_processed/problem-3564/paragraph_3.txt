Nobody is claiming that Venezuela doesn't have sovereignty over these offshore resources. They're free to develop them themselves, or to negotiate with third parties to develop them, or to refuse anyone else access to them. The trick is that, right now, any third parties involved will have problems if they also want to do business with the US, due to their sanctions.
