The first time he was toppled it was by Lieutenant Colonel CÃ©dras who was a known CIA asset. Aristide was hated by the elite because he really did target corruption and punished people with ties to the Duvalier regime, which included most of the Haitian business and military elite. Some of his supporters were very militant and stormed the National Palace when the Nation Assembly threatened a vote of no confidence to remove Aristide's choice for PM, Rene Preval. That was the excuse for the coup. Aristide himself never broke any laws. In any case the military junta that replaced him murdered thousands of people for political reasons. The military dictatorship had a paramilitary death squad that slaughtered and looted civilians with impunity.
