I'm willing to give the Fox execs credit for knowing what their viewers want. It ain't truth, ESPECIALLY unwelcome truth, e.g., as many votes as Trump received in 2020, Biden got over 7 million more. OTOH, no need to run Fox viewers' noses in the fact that Biden won as many electors in 2020 as Trump won in 2016. IOW, if Trump won an Electoral College landslide in 2016, he LOST in a landslide in 2020. Meaning those Fox viewers backed a LOSER.
