But unification is opposed by all "relevant" countries (that have signed the armistice, i.e. North Korea, China, Russia, the US). Japan also opposes it (already enough competition from South Korea). They prefer a weaker divided nation and keep the status quo. Otherwise they would have let unification happen already; it's an international issue beyond the Koreas because of the agreement.
