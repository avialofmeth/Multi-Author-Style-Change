Barrett is bad for the court because she's an under qualified puppet that was just picked by Trump getting blindfolded in a room full of Republicans and spinning around while pointing. When he was too tired to keep spinning (3/4 of a spin), he was pointing at Barrett. There were tons of people that deserve the job more than her.
