When I was in the marines I always saw the marine corps times (I'm pretty sure its the same company) as kind of a tabloid for Marines. Entertaining to read but mostly focused on drama around the commandant or the government mixed in with "how to avoid a hangover‚Äù type articles. Also the crossword was easy enough to be doable for someone on a crayon diet so that was nice.
