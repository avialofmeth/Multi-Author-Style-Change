The sanctions are having the intended effect on Russia. Yes, the oligarchs and government can mitigate some of it, but then the other side counter attacks... it's part of the war and the combatants in these battles are wealthy people and banks. Attacks, evasions, interruption of supply lines and, unfortunately, civilian casualties. It's war and it sucks.
