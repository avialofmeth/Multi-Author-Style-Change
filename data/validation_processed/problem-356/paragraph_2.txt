Yeah, I made a video on the bird flu a few months back when the vast majority of shorebirds on the West coast of Northern Europe died from this. It took forever for the news to report on it in sidenotes. Then it vanished again completely. Now, there are trickles of news here online but just trickles. Here in Germany, the only sign of the bird flu is a literal sign near my house that announces a bird flu observation corridor.
