It makes perfect sense, and if you think Trump's 74 million votes was some kind of earth-shattering record, imagine how much more votes he would've gotten - especially in the key battleground states where it actually matters - if he hadn't continually pissed off his base nearly every chance he got. All because Trump couldn't resist throwing snark on twitter. "Owning libs" doesn't count for much when he shot himself in the foot every other week.
