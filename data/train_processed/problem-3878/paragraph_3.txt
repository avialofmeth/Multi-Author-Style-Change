To elaborate, the entire North East is largely agricultural flat-ish ground. The upland farms he/she talks about are mostly seen in the highlands and west coast, where the terrain is very very rugged. The south and north east (and plenty of land in between) plant many crops, in the north east you can drive from one side to the other and only see crops around you (the lack of farming elsewhere seems to be compensated by making nearly the entire north east farmland.) Typical crops you see in those areas are mostly Rapeseed and Barley.
