The problem is that with the size of the country even 15% of the voting population is close to 30 million people. With conservative propaganda networks and sound bite journalism, he was propelled to the highest office in the land. DeSantis will have the same media machine behind him, but he lacks that x factor that Trump possesses. Even if you are not swayed by his style, his personality dominates every room he is in. At the end of the day, voting is a popularity contest and he has a devoted fanbase that we are now seeing is willing to resort to violence. DeSantis just doesn't have this cult and Trump will be unwilling to hand it off without a kings ransom, and even then, he might not keep his word.
