4 years. The reason for instability of the last few years is that there were 3 blocks of parties that didn't want to seat with each other, where no one of them got 50%+1. 2 governments that were formed during this period were parties from different blocks joining and then being torn a part due to their differences. This time, one of the blocks got 53%. There is no realistic scenario of this coalition falling apart.
