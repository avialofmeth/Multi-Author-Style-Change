Man, as a progressive I say this all the freaking time when moderates campaign against progressive teammates, FRIENDLY FIRE DOESNT HELP WIN ELECTIONS. You're just alienating your own. Focus your ire on the literal fascists. Vote your consciousness in the primary and then fall in line with the party most fitting your ideology for the general.
