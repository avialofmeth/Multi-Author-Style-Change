Second, Ukraine started mobilizing right away in March and has access to very good trainers. Russia only mobilized recently and was actually sending military trainers and teachers to the front prior to that, which severely depleted their ability to train the conscripts. The fact that Russia, who has fought in a dozen wars in the past few decades is relying on Belarusian trainers, who have fought in zero, is not a good sign. Ukraine has a 6 month head start and much better trainers at their disposal. The two armies are nothing alike.
