On Tuesday night, Senator Bernie Sanders withdrew a measure to end U.S. support for the Yemen-Saudi Arabia conflict. President Biden stepped in, reportedly vowing to veto the measure if it passed. Two California senators declined to support it and although two Republicans publicly were in favor, Sanders withdrew the measure because "the votes weren't there" for a bare minimum 51-vote passage.
