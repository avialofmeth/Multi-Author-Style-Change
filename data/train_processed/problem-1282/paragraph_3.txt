I think it was actually because Gatez wanted on the armed services committee and was not getting it, which was mentioned in another article. He has no business being on it though. Crazy coincidence that Trump is rumored to have hidden documents about the energy sector and that is a big part of what this committee has oversight on. I havenâ€™t seen anybody else make that connection.
