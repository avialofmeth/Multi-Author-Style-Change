But when you’re a sociopath, none of that matters. Imagine being a guy that’s in litigation of some sort every day for the last 30-40 years. Or being a guy that doesn’t pay employees or contractors. Or having kids with 3 different wives and a wife that’s almost the same age as your sons. You have to have a real narcissistic condition, which to some degree is remarkable. Few of us could live like this.
