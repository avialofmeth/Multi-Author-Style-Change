The policies he's passed with such a divided legislature required someone with experience negotiating them. Of particular note was getting Manchin to indicate he wouldn't pass the Inflation Reduction Act so Republicans would vote for the CHIPS act, then turning around and immediately supporting it. The handling of the Ukraine situation is right in his wheelhouse too, and I don't know if it could have been done better.
