Oh I am not saying I am an expert, I am just a dude who read a bunch of articles, don’t get me wrong, but with that being said I don’t think it’s fair to assess my understanding of the situation based on a 5 sentence answer to a comment that mentions that China can simply blow everything up. If you read my next comment you will see me presenting the opposite case arguing why it might invade Taiwan. And to be clear since my comments kinda contradict each other, I don’t think China will invade Taiwan, but I don’t rule out such a possibility.
