Because no vaccinations stop you from becoming infected. That just isn't possible. Vaccines allow your body to deal with a simulation of infection and produce the necessary antibodies to fight the infection without also having to deal with the additional adverse reactions that a live virus brings. Once you are vaccinated, if you are infected by the real virus, your body already has the tools to put up a much better fight than if it had not been given a trial run via the vaccine.
