Also a lot of the vehicles and weapons the US is sending is old stuff that was set to be demilitarized anyway. Things like vehicles have a life expectancy and after a certain point they cost more to maintain than they’re worth. The US doesn’t want to keep a ton of 20-30 year old military vehicles lying meanwhile Ukraine desperately wants anything even closely resembling a military vehicle. A significant portion of the aid is basically just military surplus.
