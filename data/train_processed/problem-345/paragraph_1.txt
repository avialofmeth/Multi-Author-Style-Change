Personally, I believe Putin intended the all-out invasion of Ukraine as a legacy defining move that would put him up there with Stalin in the Russian history books. It was totally unprovoked by any western action. Seize most of Ukraine and probably Moldova too, then Belarus joins willingly. Boom, new USSR. Then Putin steps down and some hand picked puppet can negotiate with the west to get them out of sanctions hell.
