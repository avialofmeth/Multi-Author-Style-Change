Now however their more recent actions HAVE managed to bring back good old traditional Polish hatred. To the point where for instance I would recommend not saying you are Russian anywhere near Poland regardless of how old is someone you are talking to unless you know them personally. Pretend to be Belarusian or Ukrainian instead. We have in fact gone from assuming only Russian government is inhuman to realizing their whole country is rotten inside (which to an extent is even going too far but it's not something that's changing anytime soon now).
