I'd love to see them explain Judges 19 to the end of the book, where God is directly involved, and instead of stopping the clusterfuck, pushes it into genocide territory. Also, there's the whole chopping up your dead concubine and fedexing her body parts around the country to stoke rage that she got raped to death, in your place.
