A long time ago I used to fly RC airplanes. Big 5' wingspan scratch built planes. I came across a Russian guy visiting to compete in a control line plane competition (pre RC plane flying). He had this really gorgeous plane that was beautifully crafted with nearly none of the luxuries I had to make my comparably badly built planes.
