Oh definitely many were. My point was that not every single Russian is a fanatic, and as long as enough of those along the chain of command that would be used to launch their nuclear arsenal don't want to die it could potentially prevent a nuclear holocaust. If every single person on that chain is fanatically loyal to Putin it's far more likely that a nuclear exchange might happen if Putin ordered it.
