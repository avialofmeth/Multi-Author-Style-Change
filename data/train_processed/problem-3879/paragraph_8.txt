It helps to see what’s out there. I ignored the homestead thing letter for a few years because it sounded scammy and dates on it were before I bought the house. I lost 2017 rebate because I didn’t apply. I applied for my 2018 rebate this year because of the noise of around changing into ANCHOR. At the very least I get something back from what I’ve paid even if I have to wait until next year. It’ll help me catch up on other debts that came around from these past two years.
