Speaking of which. Something that I've been trying to figure out, I also live outside the states so maybe I don't have a full grasp on all the nuances between federal and state authorities. But Derek Chauvin and his fellow officers all caught federal charges also. My question is given the times police officers have been caught with body cam evidence of clearly violating someone's civil rights how come not all of them seem catch federal charges? Does it require action by the states AG to get the feds involved or something to that effect?
