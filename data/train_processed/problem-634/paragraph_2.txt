honestly, I hope it stays this way with the price levels. A former secretary-general from nato mentioned in an interview recently that the reason for gas prices to drop is because of less need ( less economic growth ) in China. If china needs more gas next year or in 2024 people in europe very likely have to deal with higher prices again. btw i’m no expert so i don’t know if it currently is the main influence on the prices.
