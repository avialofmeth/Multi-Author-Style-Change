They just want to consolidate their hold on that border and think that being aggressive with India is the best way of achieving that cos apparently the current guys in charge are brutes who think that burning bridges somehow isn't going to hurt them further down the line. Whether it's because they think too little of India or because they've somehow got a functioning strategy, o really can't tell. I think they're dumb as rocks personally, but hey, I'm not the one running that country.
