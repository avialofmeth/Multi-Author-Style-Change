edit: keep the downvotes coming my burmese brethren. fact remains that your shitty leader painted herself as some champion for freedom and then went to the hague to defend the military for accusations of genocide. fucking funny - the whole free world was behind her and she shat it all down the drain to defend a genocidal junta. them's are the facts, buddies, 1000 years from now scholars will look at these moments and conclude that: "damn, she fuuuuucked up bad".
