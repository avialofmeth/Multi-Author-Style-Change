The Dutch government claims the Russians where being difficult about allowing more Dutch diplomats. And to me 10 people sounds like a tiny amount to serve a embassy and a consulate. But 58 people sounds like a lot. I get it that they now only allow the same amount of Russian diplomats as Dutch diplomats in Russia.
