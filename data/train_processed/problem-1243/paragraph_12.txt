Tucker was cheerleading for the Bush administration for the entirety of the 2000s. He was fired from Fox news, denounced the Murdochs, then became the token conservative pundit on MSNBC and CNN before being fired from both. Then he created his own right-wing online network (Hotair? Dailywire? Redstate? I forget).
