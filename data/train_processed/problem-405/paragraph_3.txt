They have nukes, and invading them or whatnot is a bit over the line. So everyone is hoping Putin will decide the price is too high, and bring everyone home. There aren't a lot of viable options other than grinding it out. Unless one considers a Ukrainian surrender a viable option, and I don't think Ukraine is currently cool with that one. Nor is the rest of Europe eager for Russia to win and then start to regroup for the next invasion.
