Thanks for the link. It's not a question of liking Newsweek though. Many non US people around the world remember Newsweek as a reputable magazine and still take the name at face value without realizing what it become in terms of click-bait. I'd guess over 75% of what it publishes is rubbish or lifted from non verified sources. Some of course will be true and newsworthy but as a primary news source its of little use.
