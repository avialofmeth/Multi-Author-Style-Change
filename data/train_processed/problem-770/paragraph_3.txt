Michigan appears to have “built back blue,” and has a strong list of candidates to offer on the Democratic side. So I think the D’s will keep the seat. The only way to lose will be if a “normie” Republican like Fred Upton slips past the primary (unlikely) and/or the Democrat chosen is a weak candidate or runs a terrible campaign.
