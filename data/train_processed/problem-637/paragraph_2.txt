I find myself wondering about the first amendment relative to religion versus the press. Religion was historical people writing words about acts and other things they could not yet explain. Journalism or the press is writing words about acts and other things they have not yet explained. Yet, religion gets a first amendment prohibition against regulation, while journalism does not. It doesn't seem fair.
