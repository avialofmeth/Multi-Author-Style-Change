He’s literally ok with Muslim women of India being raped because they’re Muslims. And the rest of his arguments only shows that he is in fact indoctrinated with such thinking. And is ok with Russian terrorism and terrorism of Muslims (just because they’re Muslims) is that the actually correct way of thinking? But of course you’re Indian as well so of course you’re backing him up. I’m very disappointed in him and thank you so much for your useless comment.
