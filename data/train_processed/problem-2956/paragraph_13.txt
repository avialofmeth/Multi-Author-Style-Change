They didn't both arrive at the same estimate. Neither Milley nor the European Commission gave an "estimate". An estimate is based on some kind of methodology that can itself be reviewed. Milley was speaking off the cuff and someone at the EC likely quoted him when they shouldn't have. I'm not sure how to make this any simpler for you.
