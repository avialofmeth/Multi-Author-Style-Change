Alex Jones was kind of a special case, basically a perfect storm of lawsuit losing conditions. First, he had a profitable business making lots of money off of his lies, so there was a target for lawyers to go after. Second, his legal strategy was "piss off the judge as much as possible." Third he refused to comply with basic court requirements, which was good for fundraising but led to a default judgement against him. Fourth, Jones got caught lying about discovery. He claimed his phone had no relevant messages, and then his lawyer "accidentally" sent all of those nonexistent messages to the prosecution in full.
