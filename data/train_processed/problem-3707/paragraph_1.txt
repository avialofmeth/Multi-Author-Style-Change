I was just the other week here on Reddit arguing with people who informed me that China did not have strong influence in Canada, nor were the Chinese at all responsible for the housing crisis in Vancouver and that I’m just xenophobic and looking for an excuse for my own inability to afford living in BC. Wonder what they’d have to say about this.
