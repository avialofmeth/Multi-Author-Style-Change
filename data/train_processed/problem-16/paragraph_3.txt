in Russian society it's simply consensus reality that there are neo-Nazi irregular troops in Ukraine, who have been bombing civilians for years, and they're getting their weapons from NATO (now indirectly, since Congress banned sale of weapons to them). How much NATO condones or even orders those attacks is up for debate, but yes, a Russian would totally agree that if you let terrorists have missiles they will bomb civilians. Depending on how truthful it is (I doubt it's 100% lies, there's people with family members in Donetsk).
