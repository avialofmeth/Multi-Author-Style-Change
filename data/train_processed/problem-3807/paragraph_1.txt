Actually that's not the whole story. Haaretz reported yesterday. Netanyahu wanted Ukraine to vote against the motion. Zelensky told him that in exchange for a vote in his favor or official abstention, he needed military support for the war. Netanyahu declined to commit military help but told him they could speak about it at a later point and Zelensky gave the order for the UA representative not to show up so that UA keeps the door open if Netanyahu chooses to help in exchange for a favorable vote. In this case Ukraine did not officially abstain either, they did not vote and abstention requires a vote.
