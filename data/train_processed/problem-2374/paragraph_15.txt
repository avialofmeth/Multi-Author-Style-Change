Especially since the labor shortages are so bad currently because during the height of the corona crisis instead of using the for the crisis easy to use "Kurzarbeit" (I don't know the english term, it's when you can reduce the weekly hours but the employee gets part of the lost money from the state) and instead fired absolutely everybody that wasn't needed to keep the company going while there was very reduced business and now that the market is growing again the applicant market is extremely low because - surprise - every company now realizes that they will need the people they fired again when they want to do the work they did pre Corona.
