I mean Jean-Bertrand Aristide was the first ever democratically elected president of Haiti since independence and one of the main pro-democracy leaders who overthrew the dictator Baby Doc Duvalier. He was elected as president twice with substantial majorities. And he was overthrown by two military coups, not by popular will. Whatever you think of him, the people wanted him to be president. The military hated him because he wanted to impose civilian oversight on the armed forces and they were used to complete independence and the wealthy hated him because he arrested people with close ties to the Duvaliers (which was most rich Haitians).
