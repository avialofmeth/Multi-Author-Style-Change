The problem here is that there are a fair number of states that have already been gerrymandered to have a republican legislature with a democratic leaning populace. Those would never turn democratic again. The firmly red state will stay that way and the firmly blue states may enact something like this (but probably not). States with split representation in the US house could be changed to solidly red because of how they draw their own districts. (or just throw out democratic candidates). An actually purple state like Texas or Florida could change all their reps and basically lock in forever republican rule for the rest of the country.
