The issue is transparency availability and again it's a broken system. No matter how hard I try (another American here) nothing matters. They burn and dump all our shit in the same spots. Make sure to make ev impossible. Where we spend our dollars ends up back in like 10 companies hands who also have a large stake in oil. It's time for a French revolution type of solution but it's not feasible in today's age. So all were left with is throwing ice into the ocean hoping it helps as corporations ensure it doesn't matter.
