A large component of this pollution is due to stubble burning in Punjab. Previously, the Delhi govt used to point fingers at Punjab for not taking steps to reduce pollution. This year, the same party is in charge of both the Delhi and Punjab govts, so the onus is really on them to implement actions. Looks like they've failed spectacularly, and are now searching for someone else to blame.
