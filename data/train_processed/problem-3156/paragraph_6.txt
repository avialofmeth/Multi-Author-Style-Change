That was before climate change, consumer interest, and geopolitical motivators expedited sustainable energy tech. Oil will always have some use/value but probably never more than it has today. The US will probably be the first superpower to have a completely electric fleet of military/civilian vehicles but I don't think that is possible for a few hundred years at least. Having the ability to spin up production of oil on a dime without having to import it means the US can operate its military equiptment unimpinged indefinately (from an energy resources standpoint).
