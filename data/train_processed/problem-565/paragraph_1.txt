I once went to a resort in Domincan Republic. It was filled with Russians. I had never really been around Russian citizens like that before. I had a few Canadian friends that were Russian, but that’s about it. The Russians at the resort though… They were the worst! If you stood in line at the buffet, they would just cut right in front of you, take every last bit of whatever food was in the tray, load up a full plate of it, put it on the Center of their table then grab another plate.
