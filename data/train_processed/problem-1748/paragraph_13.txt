On top of that, there are people who don't think Putin has gone far enough. They've taken the propaganda and really ran with it! Some of them will not be satisfied unless Ukraine is destroyed in a total victory. These ultra nationalistic people who are baying for blood and total conquest could cause Putin a major headache as anything but a total victory will be seen as a failure and a sign of weakness. If Putin were to be branded as a weak unpatriotic cowered by enough people to gain significant momentum it could be very damaging to his fictitious image as the tough strong man of action, a world leader on par or greater than American presidents.
