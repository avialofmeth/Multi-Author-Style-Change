Many disabled workers, by definition of being disabled, cannot make fully autonomous decisions and provide for themselves as a consequence of their disability. The employer need not be the sole provider in this circumstance. Your points 2 and 3 apply standards to disabled workers that are only fair to apply to fully able employees. 14c labor is heavily subsidized by the government in many other ways, and that is why the groups that represent disabled families are happy to see these programs continue. They provide structure and meaningful outcomes for many people who would otherwise not have purpose. The employer and wage are only a small part of the policy structure that supports this.
