Presenting that bill as being primarily Republican in character, especially in a way that then suggests the ACA was bipartisan, is a pretty damn extreme stretch and spin of the situation. The fact that one very nonstandard Republican reluctantly supported some of it doesn't take away from the fact that it was a very liberal bill.
