I'm not fully convinced that they will, but the American intelligence has been on point this conflict and they are reporting that the Chinese are seriously considering it, so I think we have to take it as a very real possibility. We additionally have seen the Chinese send their top diplomat to Moscow during the 1 year anniversary of the war, come out with a peace plan that favours Russia (as it would draw a cease fire around current battle lines) and Xi is slated to visit Moscow for a meeting with Putin soon. So clearly, they seem to become more involved - to what degree remains to be seen.
