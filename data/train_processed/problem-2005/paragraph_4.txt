I'll try to answer my own question here: the fears that the GOP stoke allows people to demonize "those people", which is somehow acceptable, especially if it's not overtly phrased as racist (and even sometime when it is). But those that the Dems stoke require targeting of groups that we're told are off limits. Climate change and income inequality require us to target the rich and "that's not good for the economy", while reproductive rights require targeting christofascists and that's "religious discrimination".
