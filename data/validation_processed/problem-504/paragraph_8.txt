"Water is a greenhouse gas," is a common denialist talking point. Its true, but by and large, it isn't an enhanced greenhouse gas, because it saturates in air based on temperature and condenses. Most parts of the atmosphere already have all the water they are going to get, give or take the day's weather. The greenhouse effect is why the planet has an average temperature above freezing. The enhanced greenhouse effect is why that temperature is increasing, and it's the effect of concern.
