I'd posit that they did have record of them, but don't look at that list; most of these docs are likely to just be daily schedules and minutes from meetings that aren't of a national security nature. They're only classified bc they are almost immediately. Then they should've been declassified bc of their benign nature, but got overlooked and weren't. They're only looking out for the ones of national importance, which is why they knew what was missing when the orange refused to give back the documents he had, triggering the raid on MAL.
