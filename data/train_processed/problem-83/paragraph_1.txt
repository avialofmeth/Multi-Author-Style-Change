I feel like Swiss neutrality is kind of pro-Russia. It feels kind of like a crime of indifference; just think back to Nazi Germany and how we call out people who lived back then and didn't support the Nazis yet decided to do nothing. We mostly just blame them for going along with the Nazis due to their indifference.
