"First gay man elected here," "First transgender woman elected there," "First Native American," "First woman of color," "First Black governor of the state," as a White guy I can't relate first hand to these victories, White folks have been represented in politics since the invention of politics, so for me this stuff is all gravy and icing, it's a cherry on top, it's a subtle sign that we're moving in the right direction, albeit not as quickly as anyone would like.
