Falun Gong has very dubious international connections (see Donald trump) The religion itself isn’t indigenous to China, and has only been in existence since the early 90s. It’s quite well known to attract scam artists and criminals. Very similar to say, the church of Scientology. The mention of ethnic sinoism is in reference to the “Winnie the Pooh is Xi” memes that come directly from racist memes spread by Falun Gong. Falun Gong enjoys a wide range of international promotion for their claims of “persecution”; they are in reality a puppet cult for clandestine orgs like the CIA.
