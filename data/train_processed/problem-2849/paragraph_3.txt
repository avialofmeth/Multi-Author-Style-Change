Until Donald Trump, nobody ever cared or wondered if a US President possessed classified documents. I would bet my life savings that the National Archives has periodically notified ex-Presidents or other politicians that certain classified documents were not accounted for. And the proper response was to find them and return them. And the public never knew.
