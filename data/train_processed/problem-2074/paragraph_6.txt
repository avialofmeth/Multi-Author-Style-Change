I get his point about accessibility and that it's both hypocritical and often inaccurate (because the items are often not displayed). But there's a difference between returning something to let's say Greece or Peru, and returning it to a currently very unsafe country that's ripe with terrorism and corruption (yeah clearly there's corruption everywhere but all I know about Nigeria is that it's a whole different level).
