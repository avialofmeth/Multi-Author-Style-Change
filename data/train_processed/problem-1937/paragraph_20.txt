I broadly agree with the thinking and rationale, though I don't know that it's the United States that should be pushing for peace, I only say that because we're currently Ukraine's biggest military partner. The United States taking a leading role in advocating for peace could send the message that we aren't squarely aligned with Ukraine, that being said I have no doubt that Joe Biden is constantly whispering in Zelenskyy's ear at every opportunity.
