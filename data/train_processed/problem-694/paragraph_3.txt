There are AP classes approved in FL if you generally care, follow the entire story about how the system reviewed the curriculum and what the problems were that were brought up. Then look at the changes that were made and the comments from the institution. They had intended to remove that content for some period before this came to light. People want to gloss over all of the facts to this event to make a politically motivated statement. People that really care about provenance and truth would do a better job of researching something before they grab their politically motivated torches and pitchforks. This behavior won’t help anyone. It’s intentionally divisive and it’s purpose is obvious.
