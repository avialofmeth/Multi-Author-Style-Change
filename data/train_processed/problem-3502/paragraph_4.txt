I think a very visible international trial for war crimes would do the rest of the world quite a bit of good. Shooting her in the face might be fair justice, surely, but a protracted show of international condemnation would be so much better for everyone (except Russia, of course, but they'll bitch and whine and lie like they always do anyways so who cares?).
