For me the core difference between legalising weed and mushrooms.. pills, etc.. vs things like heroine and cocaine is how addictive they are. Do you go full ham and not limit people’s use of it if it’s legal? That’ll go wrong - look at the opioid problem big farma caused handing out much weaker opioids like candy. Do you restrict them to certain amounts per person? Same problem but now you’re just recruiting en masse for the illegal drug trade.
