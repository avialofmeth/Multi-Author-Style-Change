It's called "Enlightened Centerism" They think they are "above" the fray of political squabbling. They see "both sides" as being problems while ignoring threats to democracy and open racism . They feel sooooo smart thinking they are an independent thinker while the rest of us follow parties blindly. They are idiots who want to feel smart.
