Without coming out and saying it they are saying they are going to fly with broken parts. Which is fine if the coffee maker is broken. Itâ€™s not fine when the backup or safety system is broken. A fully functional airline, with no spare parts, would park some planes and strip them every time they need a coffee maker, lav pump, or backup generator. Russia is saying fly them all.
