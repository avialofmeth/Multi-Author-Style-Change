I blame megachurches and nondenominational pseudo Christianity. Demagogue pastors are basically assuming the role of tribal warlords in rural America and enforcing a paranoid and primitive social structure. And unfortunately our capitalist overlords have found benefit in allowing their anti- intellectual, anti-government movement to flourish.
