Now, all of these groups operate with varying degrees of independence from Russian central command, though they can’t deviate too much from what the Army wants since they still share the Army supply lines. Just look at how when Wagner stopped attacking Bakhmut and instead threw themselves into moderately to very successful offensives north of the city, like capturing Soledar. They were promptly punished for acting out of line by having ammunition supplies mysteriously be redirected and being disallowed from recruiting prisoners anymore. Competition is still fierce though, and many believe it was one of the rival mercenary groups that leaked the location of Dimitry Rogozin’s birthday party to the Ukrainians, which as you may remember resulted in him getting a rear end full of shrapnel. It will be interesting to see if the Russian state monopoly on violence degrades further in coming years, nobody seems to care PMCs are illegal in Russia.
