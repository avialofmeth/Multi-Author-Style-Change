It's really hard to say whether putin will accept a minor victory, just keeping the land he has now. But its definitely the case that he wants to punish Ukraine for defying him and hurting his image even if he doesn't end up taking the territory. If putin keeps any territory then you should fully expect the genocide of any Ukrainians left on that territory. It's already started with forcefully drafting Ukrainians to fight on the front lines, kidnapping children, and executing dissidents and whole villages.
