I’ve seen multiple stories like this. Dudes will prey on people at homeless shelters, addicts, etc because they know there’s less chance they’ll go to the cops and even then cops might not even show up or DA won’t post charges worth anything. Sometimes the dudes that do this are homeless themselves and know their actions will be ignored.
