You can no longer leave Russia if you were on the first draft list which was created and used for mobilization a few month ago. If you were 18 at the moment mobilization was announced you have extremely high chances to be caught on border control and forced to die in Ukraine for Putin and his friends. The best option is to hide, but not many have it the same as not many people could leave Russia without a need to return in a few months after mobilization's announce.
