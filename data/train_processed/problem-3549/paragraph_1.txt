It’s exhausting man. He’s so obsessed with it. We’ll be talking about Ukraine cuz he’s always sucking off putin and I’m a big defense/geopolitical buff and once I start giving dozens of good reasons to support Ukraine and his “Russia great” argument starts falling apart he just starts talking about Ukrainian child sex trafficking rings and how the US number 1 export is gay sex. And I’m just like “why are you so obsessed with this nonsense?”.
