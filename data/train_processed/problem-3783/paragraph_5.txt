Bolsonaro didn't need to call people into action on Jan 8th directly. He has been poisoning his followers with fake news about the elections being fraudulent (before the elections ever happened), asking people to arm themselves in case Lula wins, and much more. He fed those peoples lies for months before last weekend.
