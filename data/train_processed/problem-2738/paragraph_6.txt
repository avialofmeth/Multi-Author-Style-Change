Also people on reddit need to stop casually throwing around the word 'slave labour'. The wages are far lower than in developed countries, sure, but the conditions are still far better than the smaller, companies, but more importantly, working in an apple factory will be WAYY better than working in the unorganised sector, from where employment is transferred to the organised sector when large companies set up factories. Then there is the issue of seasonal unemployment and pseudo employment, which are also addressed by these.
