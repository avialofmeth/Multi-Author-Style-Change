As bad as McConnell has been, the real damage was done to the court when Nixon replaced 4 of the 9 SCJs. The Warren court was very progressive and Nixon turned it Conservative in just 3 years. Not so fun stat: of the 21 SCJs that have been appointed in the last 55 years, Republicans appointed 16, impeached presidents appointed 9, Nixon + Trump appointed 7, Democrats appointed 5. The fact that two of the most corrupt presidents in US history have appointed more SCJs in the last half century than all Democrats combined is terrifying.
