I’m not sure anyone can answer that question. First of all, because until the war began the Kremlin managed the situation itself where it could and tried not to act directly where it wasn’t in control. Now Putin is not in control of the situation, he is clearly not able to put even part of his plans into practice. Predicting his behavior under such conditions is very difficult, as is predicting the behavior of the Russian elite. We thought they were stronger and more reasonable than they turned out to be. But maybe they will turn out not to be so weak?
