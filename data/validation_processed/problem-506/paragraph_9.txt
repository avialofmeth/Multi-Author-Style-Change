Neutralised how exactly? On the frontlines they have come to a gridlock, as was recently stated by Ukraines defence ministry. And HIMARS arenâ€™t stopping all missiles that are hitting Ukrainian infrastructure and civilians nearly every single day from the front lines all the way through to Odessa, Kyiv and Lviv. Ukraine might be knocking 70+ /100 missiles a day but many are still making its way through, hence the constant power outages across country.
