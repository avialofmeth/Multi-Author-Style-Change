You keep saying they publish this stuff in the name of free speech. You donâ€™t have to like or appreciate the magazine but I think they think about it differently, I think they feel they have something to say and since they are free to say it, they do. This is protected by their Constitution, by UN treaties, by the EU. The leaders Iran have complained non stop about the USA, UK and Europe, often rightly so, for decades. No one puts out a fatwah on them for hating us or ridiculing us. I have zero patience with this argument against speech.
