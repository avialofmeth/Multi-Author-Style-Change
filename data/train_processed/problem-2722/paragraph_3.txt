It's like if one sports team in a game realized that they could commit penalty after penalty and at some point the ref will stop calling them for a penalty because it would look too lopsided. So they let the offenses go and call penalties on the other team to balance the perception. Trump did this, he didn't slow down committing crimes after law suits and everything of the sort, he got worse and the ref started calling penalities on the other team. Now his team has the advantage of doing whatever they want because it wouldn't look fair to keep investigating him.
