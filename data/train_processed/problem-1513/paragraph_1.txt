We can hope. But lets not ignore how often people of power including politicians have fucked things up in the past. Or imagine what could happen if the republicans in the USA now or in the future would win at least one majority in the house or senate and/or presidency. It could either be a deadlock (Biden couldnâ€™t do shit) or they would do worse (Biden could still not do anything except use his veto). And that is just the USA. Lets not talk about Erdogan and others.
