Lolz, Judge Cannon got slapped back into last week by an all Republican appointed 3 judge appellate panel (one from GW Bush, two from Trump). They felt it set a horrible precedent that would either crave out a special exception for ex-presidents or even worse a general precedent for other criminal defendants that would allow them to request similar treatment.
