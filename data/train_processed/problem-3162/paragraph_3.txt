Some of the documents in question from recent headlines may also be copies of documents that were meant to be destroyed but never were. If, for example, the President or VP is given a copy of a classified briefing but it isn't "THE" copy of it bound for the archive, they wouldn't necessarily catch that it's missing if that document does not get destroyed as expected. If the President or VP makes notes on that same document, there might have been reason to save them, but this creates an additional step where the document has to be updated and re-archived.
