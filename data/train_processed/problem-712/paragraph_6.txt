It was as moronic in the 1950s as it is now, but Russia doesn't really have any other choice. No one is threatened by their conventional forces anymore with how much they've struggled in Ukraine. Only option to even look powerful going forward is to expedite the retirement of the older RT-2PMs, UR-100s, and R-36s for newer ICBMs, rush the production of RSM-56 SLBMs for the submarines, continued production of the Kh-101s for increased survivability vs the now antique Kh-55, etc.
