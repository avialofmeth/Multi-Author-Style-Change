Iranian security forces massacred 96 civilians in balochistan last month, iranian sunni clerics are intimidated and even killed because they are vocal when it comes to iranian-backed militias killing sunnies in Iraq and Syria. Another reason is in the sunni tradition, sunnies are only allowed to pray in sunni mosques but the Iranian government forcibly close the sunnni mosques so they could pray at the shia shrines, all under the false guise of "unity". Don't belive me.... Sunnies own or control 9 mosques in Tehran, and to call these "mosques" are disingenuous as some say they are legit prayer rooms not mosques.
