Ah pretty sure plenty of witches were hanged or otherwise executed in catholic strongholds like Poland-Lithuania. Maybe burning was the wrong term as you're right, as far as I know, burning was more of a protestant/Anglican thing. Still, the catholics had their fair share of 'witch' blood on their hands.
