They actually earnestly believe that the 'sinners' will suffer literally infinitely more over the course of eternity, so they fully believe they are "rescuing" them from eternal torture by forcing them to suffer on earth. The rationale is, a little material suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of christ on the cross - it is our privilege to suffer for jesus on earth so we can spend eternity with him in heaven.
