I would disagree that New Year’s Eve is a bigger celebration day than Christmas in the US. Christmas is month long cultural event with school and work parties, charity drives, etc, culminating in entire extended families traveling cross country through fierce storms to make it for Xmas and then leave a day or two afterwards. Chinese new years is a bigger event than Christmas for that community, but they don’t celebrate that on 12/31. NYE is mostly an excuse to get drunk and fire off fireworks and piss off pet owners.
