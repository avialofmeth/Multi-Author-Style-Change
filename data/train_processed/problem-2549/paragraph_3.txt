While I, a depressive-anxious one, am thriving on anti-depressants and monthly psilocin dosing … I have lost a few friends to schizophrenia, which seemed exacerbated by LSD. I also believe MDMA exacerbated a few friends’ depression issues as well. This was mostly back in the 90s, when we didn’t have the such internet powers to help us connect the dots.
