Any other course of action, and especially this one, where our government stated it is willing to bankroll this conflict and the senseless deaths of soldiers and civilians that will come with it, rather than doing anything at all to bring an immediate unconditional peace, is not just evil, it is morally heinous, and I dearly hope fate judges the soulless warmongers who've taken this path with the extreme severity they so desperately deserve when their time comes.
