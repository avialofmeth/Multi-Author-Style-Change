The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing. Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region. This has come in the form of Japanese and Australian Free Trade Agreements, AUKUS and the Tempest project but also the UK’s application to join the CPTPP Pacific trading bloc. Interesting times ahead for sure.
