Tactical nukes, on the contrary, are massively overestimated. They are comparable if not less efficient than air bombings. For example, a 20kt nuke, if used on a battlefield (not a densely packed city), would only be guaranteed to kill and destroy everything in like 500m radius. Everything beyond that will be badly, but reversibly, damaged. And then it will leave an irradiated crater that cannot be used for further advancement.
