Hence the protests. People are tired of the same conservatives running congress and perpetuating the eternal cycle of corruption, and want drastic change. Hell they're asking for a constituent assembly to rewrite their Constitution that's how desperate they've become. The current government has labeled the protesters terrorists, ensuring the police has carte blanche to open fire. This will only get worse before it gets better.
