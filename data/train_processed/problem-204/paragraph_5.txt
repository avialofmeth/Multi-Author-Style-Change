Starchak Ivan " holy fuck. That guy was a badass. Thanks. Had a good read about him and his troops. They couldn't predict where they would drop in. So the Germans got ambushed a lot and where confused as to how they got there. Kinda like the story about the royal marines i heard about. They had to take a defensive position high up on sone kills with only a narrow entry point. It was easily defendable abd would have taken hundreds of troops to take. And most would have probably died. A small group marines hiked 200 km. Around. Swam a small portion and climbed the backside of the cliff. Taking out the hand full of men in pill boxes in the night.
