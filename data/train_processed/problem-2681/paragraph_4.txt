Granted, some benefits arise from extending the process: it gives more time to create interest and excitement, successive votes progressively thin the herd of candidates, which lets voters learn more about less of them. But following a sequence of states ought to be the silliest way to proceed. Is that from the days of travel by horse? The first state to vote knows the least about the candidates but has the most impact. It's backward. And they can't change their mind later when they know more. And some states may never get a say at all.
