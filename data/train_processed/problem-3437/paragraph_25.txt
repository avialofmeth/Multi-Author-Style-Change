No that would not be the easiet solution. It would require direct intervention to end Russian sovereignty. No country is willing to do this, nor is it even feasible due to Russia's size (if you assume Iraq's occupation as a starting point at 18-20 people per soldier, you would need the combined forces of all of NATO's armies + China to occupy Russia).
