This is not a phrase used in NC. I've lived here my whole life in rural NC this is not a thing when he said had a word of prayer they prayed with her. This man is a buffoon and any kinda explanation as this being a cute country phrase is lying. Like 10 seconds after in the video he's asked how he knows she's isn't involved he stutters then says good police work and you hear an audible scoff. The investigation before outside agencies got involved was a joke. The only good thing with this situation is that the fbi got involved and maybe they will actually do something.
