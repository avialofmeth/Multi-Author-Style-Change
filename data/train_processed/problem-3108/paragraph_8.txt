Now don’t get me wrong on this, we shouldn’t be using plastic straws or plastic cutlery, or plastic bags. But we are still chill with using plastic... everything else. If you drink water from a plastic bottle, ever, that’s a lot of straws and bags. And before you say “but recycling!”, recycling is a scam. It was invented by soda companies to put the onus of plastic waste on the consumer. Recycling plastic is basically a myth. As Canadians, we are Fucking up the environment, per person, infinitely more than Indianans, based on our “mentality”. Now I don’t know where you hail from, but if it’s North America, why do you think the mentality in India is worse then yours?
