I consider myself to be a LGTBQ+ ally. This is something that I agree with and believe is a great compromise. A church shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want to - a priest shouldn't be forced to perform a homosexual marriage ceremony if they don't want to because it infringes upon their personal beliefs. But the very next priest or church who has no problem marrying a gay couple should be the one to do so.
