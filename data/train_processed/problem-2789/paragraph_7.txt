Really, you've never heard of Schiff? That dude ran the first impeachment investigation against Trump. He's like a polished standard-issue Democrat. Ex-lawyer, seems like he wants to help people...also seems disinterested in rocking the boat too much. I'd describe him as "principled, yet safe". That'll help him with inter-party politics at least, I don't know how well it goes over with the public. He just gives off "company man" vibes if you know what I mean. A democrat's democrat. Probably more popular with the center left crowd than the firebrands.
