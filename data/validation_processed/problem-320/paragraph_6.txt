"Election deniers" hold their asinine beliefs in spite of ALL evidence. The GOP tried to overthrow the election, not just via a coup attempt at the Capitol, but with a series of 60+ frivolous law suits, ALL of which were rejected by courts across the country due to total lack of merit. Trump's latest suit against HRC and dems was likewise dismissed and accompanied by a heavy bench slapping and the imposition of substantial financial penalties against Trump's lawyers for wasting the courts' time with their sham.
