Thing 2. The reason private schools "seem" better than public schools is that they cherry-pick their student populations from the most affluent families. Those students almost exclusively come from 2-parent homes with virtually every advantage. Once you start taking students whose parents wouldn't normally have the means to send their kids to private school, you will find the test scores will start to equalize.
