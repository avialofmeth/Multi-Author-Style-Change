Exactly. Given Israel’s founding prerogative as a country, this situation is doubly dicey for them. Some 300K Jews live in Ukraine and some 85K Jews live in Russia, and Putin has the ability to make life hell for the Jewish community in Russia on a whim. Israel has to be careful not to create a situation where the Russian Jewish community is held hostage by the Kremlin, especially when there are many Jews from Russia that have previously fled to Israel, and have familial connections to Jews still in Russia that might be under threat. And that’s ignoring the whole geostrategic Syrian airspace/Iranian supply routes issue.
