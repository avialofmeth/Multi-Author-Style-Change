Murkowski is a far better choice for Senate than the MAGA she was running against, but I voted for Chesbro, the Democrat with a background in education, as my first choice. When Chesbro was eliminated, my vote (like most who voted for her) was moved into Murkowskiâ€™s tally, giving Murkowski the win in the second round count.
