I’d still be typically considered a conservative and yet I’ve proven the typical “conservatives are just evil” is fucking stupid. It’d be like saying “progressives are just commies” it’s not true. Yes, there are some conservatives who are so insanely conservative they’re just horrible people, but there are also progressives so progressive that they’re nothing more than a brain dead yes-man for ideas that are kinda nuts. I’m conservative because currently not a single progressive politician running for power has a single sensible idea. At least not here in Australia and not in the states or brasil either.
