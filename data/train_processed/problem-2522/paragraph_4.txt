I don't think it's going to be as tough given that Kemp won by a wide margin, but there was obviously a lot of split-ticket voting since Herschel lagged behind immensely. On the other hand, Warnock out-performed Abrams. There's going to be a chunk of voters who just aren't going to show up for Herschel again.
