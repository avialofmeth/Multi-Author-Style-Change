Part of me does think they'll actually turn on him this time so personally I'm overcompensating by refusing to actually believe it because I feel like charlie brown and the football. I can see why they may finally decide he is politically a sinking ship, but also can see why they are sort of stuck to him. He's got major control over a very critical part of the GOP voter base that they actually must keep, and these people have 0 principles. At what point do they think they can safely discard him without sustaining major damage? And if it's now, I'll believe it when I see them go all in on pushing for him to face real consequences instead of this toe in the water bullshit.
