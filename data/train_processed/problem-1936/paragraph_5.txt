I'm in the camp that believes authoritarian regimes and the billionaires are colluding to destroy platforms where masses of people could organize to criticize them and expose their lies/crimes. These platforms are not that profitable, it'll take a sponsor with deep pockets to build new social media platforms once facebook/twitter finish imploding, and said conspirators are probably waiting in the wings to be there and control the narrative.
