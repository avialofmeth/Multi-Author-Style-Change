So we now see what the GOP was doing there, trying to gain power even if it was using an impeachment and Congress (since Al Gore would have been President). We also know what was done in Florida in 2000, when the State Judge if I remember stopped the vote. She ultimately ended up in Washinon with a position in government. Then the push to change the election maps, Florida for instance gave GOP two new seats in Congress. While it suppressed Democratic areas. One could of course argue the DNC does this, but we do just not to the same extent as the GOP.
