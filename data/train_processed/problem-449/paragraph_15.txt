That's a fair question to bring up. China can always try to support the stance that they consider all of Ukraine to be the sovereign territory of Russia as the inheritor of the USSR, an argument that wouldn't necessarily conflict with their One China policy, but it will still further damage their already damaged international standing. The countries China doesn't want recognising Taiwan are the same countries who refuse to recognise Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or breakaway republics. Which is presumably why China has so far not recognised any changes in Ukrainian territory.
