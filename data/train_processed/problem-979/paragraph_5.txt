Antibiotic beef dose actually taste way better tho. American beef is delicious. Both the flavour and texture are superb and prices are so low. Puts all the beef in Europe to shame. Not that all European food is bad but if you're an American traveling in europe it's really important to remember not to order beef because it's so disappointing. And in UK they dont even particularly know how to season and cook it right.
