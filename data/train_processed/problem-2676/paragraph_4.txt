Even I’m smart enough to know the right answers to give in most situations. Hell, my workplace is probably at least 75% Trump supporters, but they all wore the masks and checked temps coming into work each day because they knew they wouldn’t have jobs if they refused. The company would happily drive a real, actual steamroller over them if they were responsible for the place getting shut down and them not allowed to keep taking orders and money.
