The rules are the same for letters -- you send someone written letter. The recipient owns the letter (the actual paper) but the sender owns the copyright (even if he kept no record about what's in it). The recipient ordinarily can sell the letter (the physical object) but not publish it for money -- no matter how famous the letter writer might be.
