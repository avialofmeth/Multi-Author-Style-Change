Hell, if I remember correctly there was another investigation or study very similar after 2016 trying to prove Trump won the popular vote and that one disappeared into thin air as well. A lot of hype in the beginning to get his base all worked up and it went nowhere because they couldn’t prove anything. But when it comes to his base facts aren’t ever the point and never really required.
