Also, your examples are just bad. F22 was never intended to replace the F16/F18, it fulfils a different role. And large vessels like aircraft carriers are not at all comparable to artillery pieces, as you only have one/a few and they take way longer to replace. French isn’t handing over all its artillery, they still keep plenty for their own immediate needs. Guess you’d know either of these things if you didn’t watch so much Teletubbies.
