There are many pro gun democrats, we just not pro everyone should have one if they have mental illness or beat their wives, we want real background checks. People say cars kill people too, well, here in GA, you can't buy a car without a driver's license, but a gun, have at it. In Cobb County you can't drink alcohol in a strip bar, but you can carry a gun to a bar.
