We've got a problem in this country where public service is attracting assholes, grifters, and sociopaths by the truckload. I don't care which whether you lean left or right (in normal times), the people you elect should have a common decency about them. They should be in it to do some good for the country, state, county, city, etc. Not for personal power, wealth, or ambition.
