Feinstein's mental state hasn't been publicly acknowledged by a single person in a position of power. Without confirmation, that reporting only carries so much weight. People we elected to represent our interests are turning a blind eye while the most populous state in the country is being represented in the Senate by someone who is no longer capable of carrying out her responsibilities. And it's likely her condition is only going to get worse from here. She shouldn't have the opportunity to finish out her term. For her sake as well as her constituents', they should be pressuring Feinstein to retire immediately with the threat of public accountabliity if she refuses.
