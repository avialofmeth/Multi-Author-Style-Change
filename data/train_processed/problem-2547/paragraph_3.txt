If a particular firearm is banned in Maryland, then what does it matter what neighboring states allow? The gun is banned in Maryland. The fact that it was brought in from West Virginia or Pennsylvania or Delaware doesn't change that. The person carrying that gun is in violation of the law as soon as they cross the border. If bans work, shouldn't those people somehow magically understand that they're breaking the law at that point, and just stop, or flag down the nearest cop and turn themselves in?
