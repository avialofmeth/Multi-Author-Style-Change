Biden could save a baby from a burning building and Republicans would criticize him: for not putting out the fire too, for using it as a photo op, or that the baby's mother worked for Planned Parenthood or something. That baby could be the next Hitler. Did anyone notice that when Trump was president we didn't have all these fires? These "Biden Fires" are popping up everywhere these days. I'm not saying it's a deep-state false flag, but just... asking questions.
