I lived in Russia for around 5 years in late 1990s-early 2000s (excluding holidays abroad), right at the end of Russia's full democratic experiment, and when Putin's authoritarian (now totalitarian) regime was starting to chip down at civil liberties and democracy. I also read both government and anti-government Russian media, so the guy who responded to you is wrong.
