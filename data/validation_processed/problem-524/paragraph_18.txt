You also ignored how Navalny condemned the fact it was annexed at all, something which nobody in today's Kremlin would dare to say out loud, and was and is considered a crime of calling for separatism. Navalny is absolutely not fine with it simply "belonging" to Russia. If he wanted it to just remain part of Russia, he'd say it belongs to Russia or not even mention the issue, rather than "risking" losing it.
