So yeah I support any effort to help people off heroine and similar, and we definitely shouldn’t be punishing them for their addictions. So injecting rooms, clean supply are all good. But a total legalisation where anyone can go and buy whatever they want like cigarettes or alcohol for heroine? I can’t see any way it wouldn’t be a total fucking disaster. If someone has some research that contradicts what’s happened with the over supply of all other legal opioids, by all means I - willing to be convinced otherwise. But all I actually hear is a lot of ‘if we ignore everything we know about opioid abuse, it works well for totally different drugs’.
