This is the first time in years the Republicans have had to be a coalition party. Their party is entirely made up of snakes who will devour one another at a moments notice for a crumb of power. They’re going to absolutely destroy themselves and they’re too stupid and craven to notice, stop it, or care. Super looking forward to seeing it get worse for them lol.
