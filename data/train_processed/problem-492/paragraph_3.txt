I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. The Two state solution discussion is now dead for good and things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. These incidents are just a start.
