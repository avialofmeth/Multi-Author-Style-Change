it's either a Ukrainian AD missile that malfunctioned(which is most likely what happened), did not self-destruct, and continued to fly until it hit the ground, or it was russian cruise missile(but we don't need to know) that went astray after an unsuccessful attempt of shooting it down. like happened in Moldova around a month ago. in either case, it was unintentional.
