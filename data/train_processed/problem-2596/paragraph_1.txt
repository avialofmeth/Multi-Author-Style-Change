10/13/2022: The head of Burisma Holdings, the energy company on which Hunter Biden served on the board, has been indicted by Ukraineâ€™s Office of the Prosecutor General for money laundering and corruption, according to Ukrainian MP Alexander Dubinsky. Strange behavior IF they had been pressured by the VP to go easy on Burisma, a VP who in 2 months would be POTUS who would begin massive aid the Ukraine. Obama officials met with Ukrainian officials in 2015 to urge them to cooperate in the prosecution of Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky as the Obama administration sought to clamp down on corruption rampant among Ukrainian oligarchs. That's the same year Trump and other Republicans have alleged Biden was trying to help Burisma.
