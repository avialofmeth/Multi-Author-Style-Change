The 24hr news cycle is gonna start spooling up the speculation machine to fill airtime because apparently nothing else of import goes on that the people need to know. I remember one clip durning the Mueller investigation where I think it was CNN reported that he hadn’t been seen leaving the building to take lunch and spun that into a news segment. To paraphrase a favorite game of mine “bullshit within bullshit awaits us”.
