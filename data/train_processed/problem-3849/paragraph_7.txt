Edit: And the even shittier thing is that EA kinda blamed the fans for C&C4 being terrible. EA sent out a questionnaire to fans to ask what they wanted in the next C&C game. So, when the game did poorly, they just shrugged their shoulders and said "Well, we delivered what the fans wanted" when you know goddamn well they picked the absolutely worst suggestions that were submitted.
