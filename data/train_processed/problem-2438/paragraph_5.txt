It's not an exercise in futility when their whole aim is to create problems that both seem urgent and are inherently unsolvable in the manner they've chosen. Futility is their runway. It's, in an increasingly overt manner no less, a sort of wealth redistribution system, except you know, redistribution from the people to the agency's pockets, which then gets doled out to local police in task forces. Voila, whoever they target are now paying twice to get oppressed. And what are you going to do about it? At least a shitty president or congressperson can be voted out. The DEA is the ultimate Advanced Persistent Threat.
