Hope Hicks, she got down on her hands and knees, begged me for a Job ok, "please, Sir, please give me a Job," I said ok, and she did good, but then the Radical Left somehow got to her, and all of a sudden she now loves Crazy Nancy and Obama, can you believe it? you take a look, Very Innocent President, not like Obama or Sleepy Joe who only want to hurt our Country and hurt our Great Constitution, and nobody knows more about it than I do. and I should really be thanked a lot more if we're being honest about it, the Fake News never gives me credit, it's a horrible shame. ok, no more questions, especially not from the Fake News.
