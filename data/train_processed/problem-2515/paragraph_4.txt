Are these laws actually enforced by the government or are they only enforceable by officials of the Muslim faith? It seems like women are attacked by "morality" police, not the police as they are represented in many other countries. I had always thought of them more like religious security guard or neighborhood watch, who don't hold any legal power in the US but maybe it is different.
