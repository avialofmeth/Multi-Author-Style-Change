The truth is that the roadrunner Coyote dynamic was a metaphor for the constant struggle between good and evil. I donâ€™t even think coyote was necessarily the evil one here. Roadrunner could very well have been the devil while god kept trying to stop his trickery. And that is what I scream through the bars of every kindergarten schoolyard I walk by during recess.
