Ahh a romantic who looks at a world which is currently in the six great extinction with 96% of all mammalian life on earth consisting of humans and their food, a world which can contain a virus because of human greed and stupidity and says “yeah nah everything will be fine we got this” if only we “build smartly” problem is we don’t have time or the smarts because 99% of the population are barely literate dumbasses who would rather fight over toilet paper than do the right thing.
