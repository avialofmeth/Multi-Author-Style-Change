However, the Government (edit: and mainstream parties) and its many arms and fingers should take a hard look at itself and its approach to its critics. There are repeated instances where individuals with legitimate opinions and analyses have been blackballed in the media, politics and academia. They are all too ready to paint anyone with an alternative opinion as "right wing", either directly or by association. This leads to a sense of disenfranchisement, which doesn't lead anywhere good.
