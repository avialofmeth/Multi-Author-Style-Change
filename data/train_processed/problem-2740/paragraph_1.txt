Hmmmm well that energy charter treaty sounds like a pretty good way for companies and countries to receive long term support for investing in a 0 carbon form of energy, like nuclear but the Germans wouldn't want to build power plants that have proven to provide baseline energy reliably. Much easier to quickly build a few more gas plants and improve slightly statistically but not focus on how to reliably power their countries carbon free for the coming centuries.
