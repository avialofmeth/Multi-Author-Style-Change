Yea I agree. There's really nothing worth entertaining that the Republican party has offered... Even the more moderate members running for office in MA. My wife and I sat down, looked at each candidate, and there was literally zero reason to vote Republican. None. Pretty much the only reason to vote R these days is literally because of QAnon, MAGA, racism, sexism, or homophobia. Massachusetts is the most educated state full of a ton of different cultures so the whole "southern strategy"("we can't be blatantly racist so we are subtly racist") thing just doesn't make sense here. Abolishing the party is perfectly reasonable.
