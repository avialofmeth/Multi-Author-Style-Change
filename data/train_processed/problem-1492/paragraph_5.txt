The first part is to make the count take longer. The second part is to insist that ballots can only be counted on Election Day. Any ballots that remain uncounted after Election Day would be rejected. And, of course, they would start counting with heavily Republican areas like in person rural voters. When the Republicans lead at around midnight on Election Day, they would just shut down the shop and declare the Republicans the winners despite piles of uncounted, completely legal ballots.
