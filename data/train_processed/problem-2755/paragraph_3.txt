Fair point. Problem is this is all just media play without any actual possibility to enforce anything new in Pakistan. It's a country of 250million and as large as nearly half of the USAs east coast. Much of the areas have poor infrastructure, zero surveillance capability, and rampant corruption. The ISI also doesn't cater to foreigners much unless really pressed. Not to mention they could be standing on the elephant in the room and not see it.
