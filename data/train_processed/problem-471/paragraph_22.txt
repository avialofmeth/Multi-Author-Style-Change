I figured he could face discipline. I graduated law school and this is just bad lawyering. As fucked as it is this TYPE OF argument you make to a legislature not a court. Obviously I don’t agree with it but the point is you don’t try to change the laws IN a trial/hearing court, at least not until an appellate level. on top of that (and just the fucked upness of it) how do you advocate for a CHILDRENS AID SOCIETY with THIS argument. I hope he loses his license.
