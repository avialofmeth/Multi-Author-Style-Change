For my part I'd just like to see Saudi Arabia get their shit together and join the modern world, ostentatiousness bothers me less than beheadings, y'know? Dubai can be the biggest and most prosperous city on earth for all I care - if it meant the UAE embraced civil rights and liberties, which they haven't.
