Everyone up in here screaming "blashpemey" and "Holy High Horse" when I say I am a messenger from God, totally forgetting that God is everyone and everyone can choose to be a messenger from God if they wish. Nothing arrogent about that. Also, if you feel pain from people like me, it's because we're shining a light on something inside you you dont want to be seen. You can address the pain one of two ways: a) crucify jesus b) clean yourself.
