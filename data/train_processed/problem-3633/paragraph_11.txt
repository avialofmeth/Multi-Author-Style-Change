God, Santos is such a child. He's 100% getting nailed with criminal charges. Saw yesterday that there were 20 dinners he went to, and the cost was $199.99. 200 dollars is the threshold for reporting. Seems like the same as 10 grand structuring laws banks use. I honestly don't get him. Maybe someone's paying him in a shell account to be as disruptive as possible to gauge how far the GOP is willing to look the other way.
