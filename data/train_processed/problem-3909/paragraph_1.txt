Powder cocaine is cocaine +HCl. Basically bonded to a hydrochloric acid molecule. Crack has the HCl removed, making it a base. In the base form it is no longer water soluble, making it only consumable through smoking. It also then hits faster and harder when compared to the HCl version. It could be argued that this higher peak in the blood due to this consumption method leads to higher addiction potential.
