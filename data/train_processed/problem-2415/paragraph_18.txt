Of that, certainly people end up holding onto those loose parts when a loved one dies. They might sell them, and I could use spares. Can you imagine flying somewhere on vacation and lose, break, have stolen, fall in the ocean, or just use? I could use a replacement ahead of time. I assume insurance won't pay for spares until you officially declare one lost or destroyed.
