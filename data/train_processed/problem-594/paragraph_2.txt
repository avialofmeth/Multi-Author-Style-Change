I agree with this even more because before WWII, many people overestimated Italy's military capacity, similarly to how Russia's military was overestimated before this war. From what I've read, Mussolini's generals at least warned him that Italy was not ready, unlike Putin's generals who seemed to tell him everything was going to be easy.
