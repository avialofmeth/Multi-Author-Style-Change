Highly doubt this comes out to be true. India would officially take the Russian side, and not just Russia, Iran as well, which makes it way worse, and sanctions would absolutely cripple them. As much as Indians want to claim, we really are not as self sufficient, and there’s only so much tiptoeing you can go about before you’re hit by sanctions. So I’m holding my reservations, and I hope this doesn’t happen, but what do ik.
