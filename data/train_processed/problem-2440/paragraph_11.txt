Undoubtedly they would have been best to have reviewed things immediately after the fall, mothballed everything and everyone except a (relatively) small cadre which were well funded (relatively speaking) and trained and built back up from there. Instead everything got neglected and lots were ruined (both material and skills). That however would have required a "plan" and there was little long term planning during the fall.
