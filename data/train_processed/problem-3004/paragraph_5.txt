After the supreme court anti abortion ruling, I went to the Satanic Temple website and bought 2 shirts for me an one for a friend. As far as I can tell, it's a bunch of lawyers and artists fighting to keep religion out of schools, government, and women's bodies. You put up a 10 commandment tablet in a courthouse? We put a statue of Baphoment. You start a Jesus group in school? We start a hail satan club. It's trolling in the best way. Like some random reddit post once asked... Who really believes in SATAN? The answer was "Christians".
