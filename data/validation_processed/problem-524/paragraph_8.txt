Also, last I checked, Russia's overall standard of living is a bit higher than Iran's, which is definitely a factor in both why so many Russians are apathetic and why they aren't exactly rushing in to die for Putin and his yachts, palaces and oligarchs. They have to be forced to do it instead. Apathy, not support, is the dominant feeling in Russia.
