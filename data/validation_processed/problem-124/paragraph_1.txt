I wouldn’t be so sure of this. Georgia’s population is highly concentrated into a few cities, which skew very democrat. For example, 50% of Georgia’s population lives in the greater Atlanta area and an additional 5% lives in the cities of Macon, Augusta, Savannah, and Columbus. Judging by vote recipient for down ticket offices is not that reliable because as a Georgia voter myself, many of those candidates run unopposed and many voters do not view these offices as political in nature. I have no issue voting for a republican coroner even though I am a pretty staunch democrat because it’s not really a political office in any meaningful way.
