Because so many ordinary Germans were, in some sense or another, complicit. The very enormity of the crime made its acknowledgment impossible by the adult Germans of the post-war era. If you want a rough American analog, the Tulsa massacre/riot did not come out into public view until all of the generation of white Oklahomans who had perpetrated it were dead. It was covered up (including issues of the local newspapers that had the stories cut out when they were archived in the local libraries). Everybody just knew not speak of it.
