A few of those seats are in California or New York or other places that are likely to elect reasonable people and unlikely to re-elect someone that impeached a president for bad reasons. IIRC the worst recent showing for a Congress opposite the president in midterms was the GOP after impeaching Clinton. Also, with margins so thin they canâ€™t afford to eject anyone from the caucus. I think they will have a hard time getting every single sitting gop member to impeach unless they actually have something, in which case the dems will likely support it too.
