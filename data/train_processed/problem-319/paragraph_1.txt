Unfortunately, the growing fascist tendencies of the Republican party make the police increasingly dangerous (the latter have always been fascist). Anyone in the military or the police force should have their background examined for evidence of reactionary tendencies and removed from service. That's certainly preferable to having all-out battles with guns under lax gun control laws. To use the old saying, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.".
