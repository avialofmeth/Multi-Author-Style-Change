It’s pretty disturbing when you look at where a lot of the culture war types get funding. It’s always Russia China saudis through well established American companies/political groups. Our enemies will not fight us in a conventional war, why would they. They are winning the war when it comes to radicalizing and dividing us while they stack our media/political organizations with sympathizers. It’s crazy to see this play out at the same time in different parts of the world, like a coordinated attack. I want moderates back but I think that ship has sailed now that these cunts are all in positions of power.
