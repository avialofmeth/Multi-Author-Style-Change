Local business leaders, Governor Doug Ducey, and former VP Mike Pence literally begged Trump to endorse Karin Taylor Robson over Kari Lake but it fell on deaf ears. Trumpâ€™s hubris means he thinks he knows Arizona better than the people who actually live here. I hate to say it but Robson, a well respected business woman would have mopped the floor with Hobbs. So Trump did Dems a favor by sticking with Lake.
