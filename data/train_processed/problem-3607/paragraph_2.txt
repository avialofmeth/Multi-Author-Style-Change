That is why the best tactic to deal with bullies is returned force. Bullies thrive on others cowering to them without a fight, because on a deep level, they are deeply insecure and try to gain a feeling of security by trampling others. This is why I do not discourage my kids from defending themselves in such a situation. The school may expel you, but if you are purely defending yourself, youâ€™re in no trouble with me.
