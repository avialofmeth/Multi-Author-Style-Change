This isn’t entirely true. It’s not 3 sick days, it’s 3 occurrences, weekdays only. And it’s not for being sick, it’s for routine checkups and preventative medicine. A single occurrence could be multiple days. For example, if you have a procedure scheduled for Wednesday and it required recovery time on Thursday, you would be able to take off with a Drs note, Monday - Thursday (Monday and Tuesday because otherwise you might not be in town to make your appointment).
