We need to peg Iran back, especially with them acquiring nuclear weapons. They must be sabotaged. Can you imagine for one moment what this dictator theocracy would be like with a nuclear arsenal. Like Russia, all that is holding Ukraine from being assisted to oust his stroops is Putins threat from day 1 that he will use nukes. Putin is only using Iran because that's all he has plus a few other despicable tyrants (they all stick together) such a NK, Syria, Venezuela and Belarus. The Iranian regime is a cancer and can not be managed diplomatically. China is the same but they want legitimacy on the world stage and don't want to be looked at through the same lense as those despotic regimes, so yes they are the enemy of the US but they don't want to be in that club.
