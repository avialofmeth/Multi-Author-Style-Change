I can tell you, I went to Normandie 5 years ago and when they heard my french canadian accent some people stopped me in the street and at random places like supermarkets and the bank to tell me how grateful they still are towards Canada. And not just old folks... younger ones in their 30s too. ''My grandpa told me about you, canadians.'' It was very moving.
