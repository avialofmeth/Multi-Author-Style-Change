Most financial advisors would say if you are that close to retirement that you are actually retiring, you should lessen your exposure to equities in favor of much safer investments. I am much further away from retirement but still had some of my 401k in bonds and what sucks about the last year is they shit the bed too. Cash was the only way not to get hosed.
