Either they’re faking bc they want to find a random fall guy, it is true, or more likely, it’s by his inner circle and trying to point away so don’t look weak. (Letter shields him from looking incompetent, like saying poisoned from unknown source would seem.) However, given that 99% of poisonings are done by the FSB, they could’ve released that detail because they want investigation/revenge/turf war. (Also, typically, they poison multiple items, then send sweepers to collect/clean, so might’ve already caught someone.).
