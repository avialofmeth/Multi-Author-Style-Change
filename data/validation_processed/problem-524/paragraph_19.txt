Also, last I checked, people, including Ukrainians, didn't leave Crimea en masse, since it was occupied peacefully, albeit illegally (AFAIK there was even claimed a large economic growth after that, to bribe the locals, as it was simply pumped away from other Russian regions). You must be thinking of Donbass, where all the major Russian crimes were committed. Suffice to say, the history of Crimea is complex, but the general feeling was that Russians, who were in majority there even before 2014 (keep that in mind) hated Ukraine, but somehow didn't mind at all being within it, as Crimea had a large measure of autonomy, and Ukraine itself was more like a 2nd Russia before 2014.
