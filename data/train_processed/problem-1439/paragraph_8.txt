They don't have to embrace the superstition though. The human brain is an input/output machine. We should be able to develop effective brainwashing techniques that can overwrite their superstitious inclinations and we can get the science at the same time. We can get the best of both worlds. Hopefully the artificial intelligence will allow us to figure out how to develop these capabilities.
