Anyway, I was blown away because to my eye the problem was a corrupt hard drive. A common failure for any computer. The computer had power, the screen worked, the inputs worked, but it failed to boot to the desktop. It did not appear to be a water related problem at all. Everything physically worked, it just didn't get past the boot sequence.
