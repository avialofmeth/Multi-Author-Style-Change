Since early 2017, so almost 5 years right now. But its been a mess of catastrophes since its been in dry dock. The dry dock sank, they had a fire ... Officially its expected to be back in action in 2024. I wouldn't hold my breath, even without the sanctions it wasn't looking good for them but with the sanctions I don't see that happening at all.
