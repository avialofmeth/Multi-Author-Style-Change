Other branches/programs of the government don't turn a profit, yet receive large budgets. Military, NASA, National Parks service, etc. You may say "But they create value that isn't quantified by money, like safety and new discoveries!" That is true, but it's also true of the Post Office. USPS is the reason online shopping is available to 100% of mailboxes in the US. Without it, either rural customers would see huge shipping cost increases, or wouldn't get service at all. A loss of customers that great would decimate small businesses on sites like Etsy or eBay, in addition to the major players. The USPS is how we transmit legal documents, jury summons, electoral ballots, and so much more. A lot of the country still relies on the mail for business or personal use, and we don't need another price increase on already-struggling families. If we can subsidize crops, gas, and road repairs, we can subsidize the mail, too.
