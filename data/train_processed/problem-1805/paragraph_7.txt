Yes, some people doubt if Germany are ready to defend others in case of Russia's agression, because of the simple fact, that for many years top German politicians have been lackeys of the Russian dictator. For example Schroder became Putin's servant while being a german chancellor, in 2005 (!) he said that Putin is immaculate democrat, after leaving office he has been still serving Russia, while remaing SPD member until this day.
