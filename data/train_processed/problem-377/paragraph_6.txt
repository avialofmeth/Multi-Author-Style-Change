again. legally they are not equivalent, politically they are. We are going to be seeing a "drip, drip, drip" of these coming out. I also suspect that all the Hunter Biden nonsense will probably yield something. Much like the Benghazi hearings revealed the "emails". Not a huge issue legally, but with the proper messaging and timing, devastating on a political level.
