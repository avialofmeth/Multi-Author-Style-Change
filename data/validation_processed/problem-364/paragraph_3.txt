If you travel more than like once a year, you should look into a travel card with lounge access or consider joining Priority Pass. You get free food and drinks, or in some cases you get a credit to spend at restaurants. It's such a value proposition, it's so easy to spend $100 in an airport bar with 2 drinks and a meal.
