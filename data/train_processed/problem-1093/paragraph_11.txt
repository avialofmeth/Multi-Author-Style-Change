There were 17.1 million more votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016. Trump did gain 11-12 million in 2020 compred to 2016, but there is no reliable way to verify your claims. Regardless, you are just pulling numbers out of your ass because there is double the number of eligible voter increased to what you cited. Plus, you are saying Trump got every new eligible voter and then some? It doesnâ€™t even make sense unless the US is suddenly like Russia or Venezuela. Go do some fact checking once in a while and stop guzzling down that propaganda you love so much. Dumbass sheep.
