I really wish people who are fans of Hillary (for the record, I am not) would defend her on her merits of policy and aptitude instead of the "qualified" stuff. Aside from "qualification" to be Prez being somewhat subjective, it's damning with faint praise. It's like saying a movie is "the most passable" film. Or Niceguys saying "I'm a nice guy, so I deserve a date/sex". I should hope a Presidential candidate is at least qualified. That's the bare minimum floor.
