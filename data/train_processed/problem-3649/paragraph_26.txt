- There are western food and pharma companies still operating in Russia that have declined to leave voluntarily because they argue that removing basic necessities should not be interrupted. The justification from drug companies is easier to swallow, but Russia is a major food producer. They’re mot going to starve if Nestle chocolate isn’t on the shelves. (Idk if Nestle specifically is still operating in Russia or not. Just an educated guess.) More could be done to pressure these companies.
