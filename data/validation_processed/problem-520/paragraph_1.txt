Its not just Western companies doing this anymore either. China is the the big one now. They've moved into areas like gold mining in Colombia and completely taken over. And they are ruthlessly efficient. Western companies always tried to pretend like they were the good guys and going to be a net positive. When this never happened, a lot of Western companies had issues with local disruption, paramilitary groups stealing and attacking their operations, etc. The Chinese come in and just straight up bribe everyone: the government, the paramilitaries, rebels, corrupt local officials. Instead of bullshit about helping develop and be a first world nation they just are like "Who wants some money? Here you go. We're taking the gold/oil/REM/water.".
