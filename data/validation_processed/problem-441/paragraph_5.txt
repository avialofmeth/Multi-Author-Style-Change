I wasnâ€™t aware of that, so thank you. I was however speaking purely on the basis that someone like Pence so far up the chain is typically a sign my assumption might be correct. So who knows, but still typically someone so far up the chain is usually reserved more towards the end of the investigation. Time will tell but I have to imagine he already had a lot more to work with when he started that typically you would not have in most other investigations.
