That the reason Newt's going campaigning with him is to help persuade these conservative crouds that what they feel is happening, is actually happening, when in reality it isn't.

Republican politicians want us to think that crime rates are going up and that we shouldn't feel safe because those evil democrats want to defund the police. So if we elect them to office, they're gonna change things and make the country safe again. However, in reality all the data shows that it's actually the red states that have the highest crime rates and have pretty much always had the highest crime rates.
