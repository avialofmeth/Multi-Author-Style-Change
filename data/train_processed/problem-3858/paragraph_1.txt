He's absolutely correct. Do you see military recruiters set up in Beverly Hills, CA? How about Greenwich? UES/UWS Manhattan? It's what we've done for the longest time. Reason a large population of our military comes from rural. They do not want intelligent soldiers, same reason law enforcement doesn't either. LAPD is a perfect case study. After Rampart fiasco, they went on a squeaky clean with college degree requirements. Wound up with a majority force that couldn't tell a drug deal from a Girl Scout cookie deal. Intelligent people questions direction and orders. That or they get bored and they wind up causing trouble.
