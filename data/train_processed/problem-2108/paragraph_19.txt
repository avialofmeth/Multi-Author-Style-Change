I did not see that as a violation of the principle of separation of church and state. I see separation as violated if one attempts to influence the other unduly or if a church orders members to vote for particular political candidates. It would be a violation of the Johnson Amendment if a church directs members how to vote. It would also be a violation if tax money is used to support particular church doctrines. Of course there can be gray areas.
