Over the last few years in my town coke has gotten super popular. People that i never would have guessed would be messing around with it are randomly offering me bumps at clubs and parties. Im no tea-toter myself, and will try a little bugar sugar every now and then, but the amount around town is kind of alarming. Its not an innocent drug amd if you don twatch yourself you can get caught up in it pretty quick.
