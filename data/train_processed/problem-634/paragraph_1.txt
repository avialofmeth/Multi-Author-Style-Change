Standing charge alone for gas and electric costs about Â£24 a month, up over 2x the previous price. After that you have gas costing 10p / kWh and electric 33p kWh. Those are over 3x and over 2x the price paid at the start of last year respectively. It all adds up and as I imagine a lot of people here have discovered it makes you aware of how much different things cost to run.
