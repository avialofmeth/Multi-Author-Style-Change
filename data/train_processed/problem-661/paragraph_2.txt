The country has a good terrorist and bad terrorist policy. The terrorists, who Pakistan exports to Kashmir is a good terrorist. So, their fundamentalist groups got funded and weaponized. Now this is coming to bite them in the ass. The whole society is fed extremist propaganda from childhood. Ask a school child there and they will say Jews and Hindoos are the enemies. Hell, even Wikipedia got banned before a day or two.
