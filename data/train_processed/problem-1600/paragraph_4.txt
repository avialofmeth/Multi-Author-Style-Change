Worst part is asshats like my brother are gonna be like, “See Biden is awful, bla bla bla.” Well yea ok that sucks but what’s right is right. I’m not married to the guy I just did not want a Russian asset in the White House. If it turns out to be a really bad situation, regardless of what fucking side your on you get punished.
