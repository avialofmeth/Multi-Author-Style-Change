It's pretty embarrassing for any outlet trying to be a serious news source. Reporting on a typo is tabloid-level content. That's one of the reasons I stopped reading The Huffinon Post about ten years ago. It transitioned over to all low-effort clickbait articles with overly sensational headlines. They were always a rather biased site, but there was a time when they were trying to actually be a journalistic news source.
