Took me some time to realize you speak about TV. Since I have a freedom not to watch it or watch anything at all. I use this right all the time and refrain from watching it or any other huge network station even though I have access to any TV in the entire wide world using my internet connection. In other words I have a right to pick the sources of information. From what I see I can say most of big networks are incredibly biased and absurd no matter if it's Russia-1, Russia-24, CNN, BBC, FOX etc.
