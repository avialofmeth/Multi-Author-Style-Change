No one likes to get the shit end of the stick, but someone always does. That's why some nations were colonizers/conquerors, and others were the colonized/conquered. Egypt was once the greatest empire in the world, same with Persia, Greece, China, Rome, Mongolia, ad nauseam, they aren't anymore. I'm sure the people in those regions would love to restore their former glory, but times have changed. And they will change again.
