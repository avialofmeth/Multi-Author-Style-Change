I think that these things are way more important and rightfully outlawed than having to pay a fine for showing your boobs in public which is also part of freedom of expression. Every country has it's own rules, it has nothing to do with thought crimes or not able to speak your mind but it's about vile content which is only spoken to divide and sow hatred.
