That being said, I have recently seen a noteworthy increase in the number of high school students wearing helmets within this past year in my small city, which I think is great. Middle school students are required to wear them here, but most of them stop once they go to high school. Itâ€™s great to see more kids adopting them whatever the reason, and hopefully adults will be encouraged to follow!
