Did you get this mad when the Israeli army was killing Palestinian journalists and interrupting their funeral processions? Did you get this mad on behalf of the ten (including one elderly woman) killed by Israeli forces in the Jenin camp only yesterday? Or is your ire reserved solely for acting righteously (and erroneously) indignated on Reddit? Because the Israel/Palestine conflict is a really fucking messy one, and these are not the first people to die in it. And they won't be the last, either.
