DeSantis ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2018 and won by only 0.4%, and he ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2022 and won by 20 points. Seems to me the difference is that Charlie Crist is an absolute dogshit candidate that for some reason Florida Democrats just cannot stop running despite his record of getting wrecking in election after election. Every single time it's the same argument "He's a former Republican, so the Republicans will vote for him!", and every single time it's proven wrong again. What happens is Democrats don't want to vote for a former Republican, and Republicans don't want to vote for a Democrat. I just can't with these self proclaimed political strategy grandmasters.
