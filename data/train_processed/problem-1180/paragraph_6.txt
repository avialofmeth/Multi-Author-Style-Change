putin hates the west. if putin dies russia could pump gas to europe again. things would be like pre war. putin doesn't want that even in case he dies. this is like an insurance to him. he said multiple times he wants a new world order. putin prefers china, india or pakistan as trade partners because they don't give a crap how Russia is ruled as long as the gas/oil keeps flowing.
