Single core power isn't just measured in Ghz, the IPC (instructions per clock) is a big factor. Its where a lot of performance increase has been gained the last 3-4 years. There are many other factors as well that have been pushing single core performance. A single core is probably closer to 12-13 ghz on the cpus from Crysis' era.
