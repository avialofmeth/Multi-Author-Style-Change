Iâ€™m sorry, is over 50 children dead, women going in to the street despite knowing if they are taken they are guaranteed to be raped and forcibly married to their prison guard, over 15,000 people imprisoned - most without any formal charges, oil and steel workers on strike, shutting down of bazaars and stores for days and days, daily protests in every single province in the country, and global protests numbering in the tens and hundreds of thousands every single weekend for 2 months straight not fighting like hell to you?
