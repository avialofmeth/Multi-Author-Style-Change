The congress refused to recognize the will of the people, repeatedly tried to oust the democratically elected president on dubious grounds to the point that the government couldn't function, then he was ousted when he tried to put the kibosh on this whole shit-show, by dissolving parliament and moving towards elections... like any functioning democracy does when they have a hung parliament.
