If the Chinese refuse, then they lose standing as a player. If they engage, it offers Zelenskyy opportunity to influence them. And while certainly China is not a fan of NATO and the US, they are not happy with this conflict and Russia's role in it either. And while yes offering lethal aid to Russia is absolutely a step in the wrong direction, it's not as if delivering couple of drones is significantly taking a hand at the conflict. Seems more like a gesture aimed at placating the Russians for the moment, so likely there is still room to influence them and Zelenskyy is trying to accomplish that.
