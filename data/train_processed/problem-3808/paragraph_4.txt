they had an agreement. Russia would accept Ukraine sovereignty so long as they refused to join Nato. Ukraine never had any intention of joining Nato for decades. that only changed in 2022 because of the war. For the most part, Ukraine still doesn't see Nato as the solution. it's people like kissy who want the war to end. Russia is a nuclear spatula power; Nato exists as a challenge to that without the need for any one nation to declare war with a nuclear capable aggressor. Nato exists to prevent nuclear war stemming from the former USSR. Here we have Russia literally mobilising nuclear warhead capable weapons. What's not to like, here? The bully in the school yard has the toughest meanest dad. Standing up to him brings the threat of dad, or perhaps mother would be the better anecdote, coming to the yard with with her giant nuclear kitchen spoon. It's going to take the entire neighbourhood to do this if the outcome demands that no one gets nuked.
