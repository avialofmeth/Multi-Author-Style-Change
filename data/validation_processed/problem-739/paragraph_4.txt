I am not sure but I can only speculate that Vedder/Pearl Jam and Radiohead used to be more universal than they are in the US,and Taylor Swift is not only universally popular across the political spectrum but also across a very wide range of age demographics (I think Gaga tends to attract an older, different kind of crowd). I’m just imagining all the parents from back in the Slammin Screen Door days and they’ve only multiplied since then; I,agile the outcry of thousands of Swifties at your door as AG lol.
