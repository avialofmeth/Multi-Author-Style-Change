The problem is that there's not a good way to integrate the Nationalists on Taiwan. They aren't exactly going to willingly subjugate themselves to the whims of the CCP. Jumping the gun on Hong Kong and Macau makes any kind of talk about "one nation, two systems" into laughable nonsense. That leaves force.
