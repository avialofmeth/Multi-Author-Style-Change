Roads have to be paid for somehow, and automobiles have negative externalities, it makes sense to have roads at least somewhat paid for by people who actually use them. I think it could be fine to, say, do something like have a rebate for people below a certain amount of income for the time being perhaps, while green stuff grows and becomes more affordable, but still.
