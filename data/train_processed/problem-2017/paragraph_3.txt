Gasoline is a mixture of many different types and weights of hydrocarbon molecules. Spoilage depends on the types and ratios of molecules present and environmental factors like the temperature and humidity. Generally the lighter molecules will evaporate out and/or the fuel will oxidize, causing heavier molecules to be present in higher concentrations, resulting in different properties than machinery was designed for (especially higher viscosity). This may result in lower performance and even malfunctions in components including fuel lines, fuel filters, carburetors, or fuel injectors. Unstabilized pure gasoline lasts for at least six months in normal circumstances, and stabilized gasoline can last for a few years. Gasoline with ethanol can go bad faster in a high-humidity environment.
