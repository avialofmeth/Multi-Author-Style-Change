What democrats need to be doing right now (well maybe last month) is to level with us about the future/economy and have a plan to make it better. I don’t even know if they have a plan they’re trying to sell and I pay some attention to politics. It’s just so…predictable. Things are bad, so try and deflect it on something bad about other party did.
