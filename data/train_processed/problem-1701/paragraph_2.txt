Ticketmaster creates problems for everyone, then creates solutions that create additional problems for everyone that cost everyone additional money and time. Ticketmaster is protecting you from scalpers! But no. And there is no alternative. Everyone is at Tickmaster's mercy. Smells like racketeering.
