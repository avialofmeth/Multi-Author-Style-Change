To remedy their challenge, voters had to show up in a county hearing and prove their eligibility - think about that. Eligible voters being challenged willy-nilly by other citizens and then having to prove their eligibility in a hearing. Maj. Turner fought it and won but his legal expenses amount to a huge poll tax - he is and always was an eligible voter, yet had to pay a significant sum to end up being able to cast a ballot. Thatâ€™s just wrong.
