My biggest pet peeve is the various "wind chill" metics. Each weather station has its own copywrited way of telling you how cold it feels. "Its 20 degrees but the Magic Weather 'Really Feels Like" index says it feels like -20. Uh, no it doesn't. I've been outside when it was -20 Fahrenheit. No amount of wind or whatever is going to make 20 degrees sting your nose and burn your lungs line -20. It's not going to magically freeze your cars coolant that is good to 0 degrees and make the tires and belts as brittle as -20.
