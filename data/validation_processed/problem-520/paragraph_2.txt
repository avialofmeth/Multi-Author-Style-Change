The issue is a bit more complicated. Africa is huge for one, and viewing it as a monolith is a common mistake. Lacking human capital is also half true, educated people are often offered better and more stable jobs overseas. Why be a professor in a country that can’t pay you on time. So there’s a serious brain drain and general lack of opportunity over large areas mean that rural areas are left to languish. So any opportunity is welcome, even if it’s an ecological disaster, its a way out.
