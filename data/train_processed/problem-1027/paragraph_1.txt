Hey everyone! My name is Andrey Pertsev and I’m a Russian journalist with Meduza. My work also appears in Carnegie Russia and Riddle. I’m best known for having sources throughout the Russian government, and understanding the political machinations of the Russian Federation. I’m from Arkhangelsk, but I’ve been to a majority of Russia’s regions and know their political structures well.
