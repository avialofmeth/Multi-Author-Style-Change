They can't do that, the government is a kleptocracy. The ruling class constantly runs out of things to steal within the country, so their only avenue for growth is to steal from other nations. They can't stop stealing, because they would open up an avenue for capital (and thus power on the global stage) to accumulate with someone Putin doesn't control, and that's not an option to maintaining his power. It's not even about being closer to Western ideas, any disent of any kind is unacceptable to him.
