I never understood why news or even fucking treaties in some cases need to emphasize that. Of course a missile is nuclear capable as long as it isn't the one of those little hobby-rockets. Anything that can carry a certain minimal load is nuclear capable. The missile just transports the bomb; the bomb doesn't care how it arrives at the target.
