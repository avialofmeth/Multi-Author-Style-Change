Yeah, Trumped was divisive. He pissed people off. But he also had a ton of support. It's even more impressive when you consider that he was against Hillary the first election, then Biden the second (and Biden is going to drum up far less GOP opposition - even though there were attempts to smear Biden he's just not going to rally the GOP against him).
