As of of few months ago, my best friend of 20 years who has always been a left leaning person and an LGBTQ ally, has started listening to Conservative talking heads he discovered via Joe Rogan. While I don't jump to conclusions and judge people on their politics, there are certainly a lot of "politics" these days that are objectively reprehensible, and he's toeing the line right now making it really hard to have a genuine conversation without being afraid of pushing him deeper or finding out some new hateful shit he has picked up.
