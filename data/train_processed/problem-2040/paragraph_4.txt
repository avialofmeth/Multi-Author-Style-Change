1990. Yugoslavia breaks up. All former republics decide to push for independence. Serbs decide this is right time to attempt another genocide, only this time they could take all of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia as well. On Kosovo they impose their own rule as part of Serbia. Running mock elections, firing Albanians from government institutions, erasing their language and culture from school curriculum, etc.
