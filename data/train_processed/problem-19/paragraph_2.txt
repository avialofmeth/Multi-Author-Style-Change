Afaik political leaders are legit military targets. If you knew where Putin was, you could go for it. That also includes accidentally killing any propagandists who are with him. Human shields don't actually work - in fact chucking a legitimate military target into a bunch of civilians is the war crime. The laws of war aren't designed to guarantee that the ones who abide by them lose. They're designed more to make victory possible and loss tolerable.
