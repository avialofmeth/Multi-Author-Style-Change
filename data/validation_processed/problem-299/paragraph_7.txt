It was supposed to cause a fatal breach in NATO between a dovish Germany and a hawkish Poland and Farnce, reveal the US as being too internally divided to support Ukraine and thus be untrustworthy, and maybe even cause such a bit of strife that an EU already wounded by Brexit might fold completely. The timing wasn't going to get better for a Russian attempt to overthrow the US-led world order, since time after Trump meant US would slowly regain some semblance of unity and credibility and the shocks caused by Brexit would end up overcome by European diplomacy.
