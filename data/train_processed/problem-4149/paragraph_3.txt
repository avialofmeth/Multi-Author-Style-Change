It’s similar to what they do in the Netherlands with weed here, the only pitfall is you’re only permitted to hold 500g if you’re running one of these shops. You can’t grow it yourself commercially, so you’re still forced to obtain weed from illicit sources. It does a good job allowing ordinary people to buy it legally and in a safe environment, but it’s still unfortunately funding criminal gangs. Great system poor execution.
