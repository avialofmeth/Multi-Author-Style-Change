It's absurd. If they want their ban they should have to pass the law again. It seems against the rule of law in general to allow a law that was written to be clearly unconstitutional at the time to stand. Legislatures shouldnt be allowed to que up laws they know can't be enforced in hopes that the supreme court decides they can one day.
