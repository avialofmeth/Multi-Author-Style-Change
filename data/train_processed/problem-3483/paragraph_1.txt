I know a guy from college who went into pharma research. He's not a bad person. He genuinely loves developing new solutions for patients. We had a telling exchange one time. I'd just listened to a radio story about a big company re-patenting a topical drug by updating its included applicator. Absolutely no change to the drug itself or its MOA. But thanks to that change it somehow kept the drug expensive. How, I asked, could the company justify it? Was there something I wasn't understanding? Was it super expensive to manufacture, was the new applicator revolutionary? Gimme the inside dope, what merits these continued high prices in his industry?
