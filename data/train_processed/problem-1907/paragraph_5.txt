Ukraine needs several hundred tanks and close to a thousand infantry fighting vehicles in addition to what the Russians have provided, some of which is only useful for scrap. Of course, America has thousands of armoured vehicles being kept in storage for... something (maybe a Mexican invasion of the US or an American invasion of China), so providing this amount of hardware is mostly a matter of political will.
