Last checked I checked, the Pakistanis at least tried to help us fight terrorists. India doesn’t do shit and then gets mad we don’t pick their side. Why would we? All you do is bitch and whine about how you’re the victim 24/7 and how everybody should placate your interests, but nobody can ever blame you for not getting involved in theirs. Some of the US’ closest allies are countries it was involved in bloody wars against (Japan, Canada, Germany, the UK, Vietnam even), and India can’t let a grudge go because the US vaguely supported Pakistan in a conflict in 1971. Like move the fuck on, Nixon and Kissinger are disavowed and dead.
