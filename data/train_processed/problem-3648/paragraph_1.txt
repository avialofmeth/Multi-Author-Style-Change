So there’s this Russian dude, yeah, and he moves to Africa. He’s really into trolling on the internet, making up fake stories to outrage people and such. He decides to go online and pretend to be Belgian, so he can fuck with the Belgians. He decides the best way to do this is to pretend to support Joseph Stalin, good ol’ days of the Soviet Union or whatever. Then someone finds him out, next thing you know he’s outed as “Belgian stalinist revealed as Russian fake news tsar in Africa.”.
