The technology we developed for space travel in the last space race is the main reason we have all of the amenities of today. It will help our fight against climate change. If you think about it for a moment, humans figuring out how to survive in basically an already closed system will force us to create more renewable technologies. This is how we got solar panels that cost less than coal which has been around way longer.
