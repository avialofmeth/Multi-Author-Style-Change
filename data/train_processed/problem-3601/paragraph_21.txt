And you do realize that "all 8 times" the agreement was always one sided in favor of Israel and extremely limiting for a state of Palestine, right? It doesn't return any of the land that Israel has stolen; it heavily limits their military; Israel has full control over their land, sea and air... essentially not actually an independent state, but a vassal.
