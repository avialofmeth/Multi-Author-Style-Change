I used to be the director of conduct at a college. I have sanctioned more cases of stupid teens than you have. Being stupid isn’t an excuse, but all of the peer-reviewed evidence on the matter suggests they aren’t developed enough. And stupid decisions have consequences that they can’t comprehend at the time. They don’t think.
