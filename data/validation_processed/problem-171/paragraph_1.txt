When drugs can be used for profit due to scarcity and illegality, nobody is safe. There are 2 solutions, legalization and government production of all drugs which removes incentive for any cartel by killing profitability, or extreme and anonymous violence designed to eliminate them, and the option to implicate rival cartel against each other. But neither will happen, drugs are part of the justification for the police state, without drugs, the only reason for crime is the poverty capitalism creates by exploitation.
