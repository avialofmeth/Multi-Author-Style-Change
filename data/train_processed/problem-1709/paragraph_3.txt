I'm a little confused since the 14th Grenadier Division (Galicia SS) was part of the Waffen SS that was founded by Nazi Germany and Ukrainian collaborators. That was the badge used by people who fought for fascists. Maybe they are not who they used to be now but the correct move would be to adopt a new symbol.
