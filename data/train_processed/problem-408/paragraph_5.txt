I assume negotiations will have to happen at some point. Unless they think they can overthrow the Russian Government which is highly unlikely. However, Russia is now on the back foot, it makes sense to push them back to improve any eventual negotiation. If we get to a natural stalemate then it makes sense to negotiate.
