Yes they've been gaining ground for a couple of months, but it's been such small gains at such huge costs that I have to ask what the Russian army's plan is here. Let's say the front does collapse in their favor and the Ukrainians retreat a bit. Then what? Just keep setting up new fronts, wasting tons of men and equipment over the course of MONTHS, and then hoping for another breakthrough?
