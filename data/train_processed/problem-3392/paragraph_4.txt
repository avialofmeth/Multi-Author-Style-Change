So yeah, it's not a Germany situation where the new guy in charge was anti-Nazi. This is more like if Heinrich Himmler and a bunch of Nazi government officials were put in charge of Germany afterwards but they agreed not to do any more genocide and the US got really close to them due to the occupation and the desire to contain the spread of communism. The main point is that now they can be expected to uphold the existing rules-based order, which is the real reason the US and most other countries don't really mind.
