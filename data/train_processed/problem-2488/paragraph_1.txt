"Defund the police" would be one. It was so bad it's speculated that it was actually the right wing which propogated it. Others would be the psycho God hates fags christians. Some times protests have more to do with virtue signaling to an in group in order to cement one's identity than effectively bringing about change. I think these protests have more to do with how the individuals have constructed their identities rather than a tually believing they're changing anyone's opinions. If they do think they're changing anyone's opinion by throwing tomato sauce at a painting, they're seriously deluded.
