No, this is wrong thinking terrorists attacks against civilians is terrible and the people responsible should be tried and punished as severally as possible. This is indiscriminate killings of people and an eye for an eye is barbaric and makes whatever political statement moot. I am sorry that innocent people died living their lives.
