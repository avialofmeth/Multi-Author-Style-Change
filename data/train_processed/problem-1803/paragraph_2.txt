As painful as rate hikes are, how can it be sustainable for fed rates to be below inflation? Doesn't that create an incentive for people (and corporations) to borrow money and invest it in absolutely anything they can, because they know they'll pay less in borrowing costs than whatever they invested in grew by, even if it only grew at inflation rates (making it a virtually zero-risk investment?).
