I’d also like to grant some credit to us being fundamentally decent people. That, and Scott Jensen being just the worst. If you’re gonna lean heavy on the football asshole’s name recognition to get votes, don’t put the whisper-talkin’ shitty doctor’s name on top of the ticket. Just run Birk as your candidate with some state house policy wonk as a running mate to reassure the moderates. Fuck, we voted for a wrestler. It should’ve been obvious: We’re nice, but we’re weird.
