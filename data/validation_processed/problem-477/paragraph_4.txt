Pick three gas station bathrooms anywhere outside of Wilminon. If you can't assemble an exhaustive list of every racial slur known to man from two of those three bathroom walls, you didn't visit North Carolina. I've had people in NC try to tell me this is 'normal'. It's really, really not normal. Nowhere else on the planet that I've lived or worked, have I seen the amount of casual racism that I saw in rural NC. I've lived in tacitly racist countries elsewhere on the globe. The level of hate I was exposed to in just one year of working out of NC was enough to have me swear off even passing through that state.
