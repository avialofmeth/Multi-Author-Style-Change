I mean Fetterman is just the sort of politician who I'm talking about - someone who is far from the hardcore Manchin style moderate, but also far from a Bernie/AOC progressive. He's sorta progressive in a sense but focuses a lot on pocketbook issues and doesn't have the radical campus activist thing of "gotta take the leftmost stance on every issue and be loud about it" that some on the left are into. He's someone like Sherrod Brown imo, another one who seems to be in the good middle ground.
