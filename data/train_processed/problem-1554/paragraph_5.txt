Almost every member of my wife’s family recently relocated from all over the country to the Clearwater/St. Pete area. When they asked why we weren’t moving down there too, I responded, “Because then my kids would need to go to school in Florida.” Not one person had a counter argument, including my BIL who is a public school administrator.
