Reagan was the real turning point in the rightward shift of the GOP, he purposely extended the Cold War, he was involved in numerous scandals, and vetoed sanctions against apartheid South Africa despite overwhelming bipartisan support. The biggest difference between him and today's Republicans is he was an actor and didn't say the quiet parts out loud. He wasn't Trump but he'd have no problems fitting in with today's GOP just like the rest of the political chameleons who pretend to be moderates when it suits them.
