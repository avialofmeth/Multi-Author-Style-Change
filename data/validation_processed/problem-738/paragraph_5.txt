Yes, the person made a point. I don't want to dismiss it completely but imagine we never make changes because things were not as good in the past. We'd never make progress. Eventually we improve by saying allowing China was bad, and we're going to ban them in the future if the UN GA or HRC makes a resolution that they ignore, for example. The way UN GA made a resolution that Russia should de-occupy Ukraine, as another practical example I'm aware of.
