No I’m American and very much anti Russian, pro Ukraine. Maybe you’re right but at the same time I don’t think many Russians are standing up to Putin - with or without Pussy Riot’s help. Does the average Russian care about pussy riot, or do they see them as a lesbian trouble makers paid for by American CIA? Probably the latter.
