People get colds and flus all the time. They come and go. Our immune system is built to fight it off. Unfortunately just like we learned in school, the strong survive and the weak do not. My grandfather died of pneumonia because he was in his 90's and his body couldn't fight it off. I didn't change my life because of this. I know that I am young and have a healthy, working immune system.
