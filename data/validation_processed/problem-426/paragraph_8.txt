What journalists always get wrong about Twitter is when they say the stream order depends on an algorithm. Certainly that is now the default stream order, but it's always been possible to use the original (and best, in my experience) reverse chronological order. I would argue that the process of imitating Facebook features like the weird reordering of the timeline has caused the atmosphere of Twitter to deteriorate.
