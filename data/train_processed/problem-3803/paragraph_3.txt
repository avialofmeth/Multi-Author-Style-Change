She says we need to "put America first" but whenever Republicans are asked to do that by giving Americans health care, higher wages, civil rights, equality under the law, justice, security, etc, the Republicans fight hard against it. The Republican party is an anti-American party. They never cared about America or Americans. All they want is to seize absolute power and force us all to practice their twisted version of Christianity while letting the rich siphon all our money into their bank accounts. Fuck the Republican party.
