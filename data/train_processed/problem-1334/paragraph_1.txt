It's true. It was more indirect calling it the lynchings based on Hindu nationalism fake news, having his ministers visit convicted lynchers etc. He's way smarter than doing it openly, he's more like Trump, in that he encourages hate while rejecting the fact that he does it. Like when Trump meets extremist neo nazi leaders and then says that they aren't that bad or that he just sat by their side.
