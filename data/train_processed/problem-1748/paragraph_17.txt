Lastly, it took some time to open investigations into some of the assassinations in the UK. People didn't want to rock the boat. They wanted Russian resources (fossil fuels and money, big donations) and some foolish people may have thought they could rehabilitate Putin by bringing him into the fold, so to speak. I wonder if that was an idealistic dream or the lie they kept telling themselves or others to justify their actions.
