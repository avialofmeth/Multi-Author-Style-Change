Im sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything was ok in any way if that's how you took it. That's just how war was, and it was extra terrible for the serfs of the region. There was a war, one country took a county or two of new land after invading. This ruzzian behaviour today is very 18th century, and that is the point I was working toward. The hostile actions were not ok then either, but the people who lived there had very little say of who their masters were. Ukrainians are their own masters now, and forever more. The ruzzians need to move out of the world that existed hundreds of years ago but is not reality today before we shall or even can allow them to live in our modern world again. In the long term they will lose the war and become North Korea. China is surrounding itself with pariah states.
