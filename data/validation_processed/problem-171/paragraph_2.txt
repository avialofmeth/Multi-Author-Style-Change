I always agreed with this.. legitimize the current drug dealers but I’m not so sure anymore. If weed is any indication of how “legalization” would work it may help a little but the government will overtax it, keeping the demand for black market around and still larger than the legit markets. Legal manufacturing and sales will have to compete with cartels paying no fiscal tax, offering a cheaper price. The government would have to lay low for a decade or so on taxation and charging millions to get a license.
