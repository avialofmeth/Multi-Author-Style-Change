Yep, guarantee you it's gonna be a maintenance guy who was told to inspect 100 cars in four hours or get written up. Nevermind that the entire industry runs on that same system due to the executives cutting most positions and that it's physically impossible to do proper maintenance with the remaining personnel. That one guy who signed off on the inspection is gonna be thrown under the bus so fucking fast by every level of the industry and government it'll make your head spin.
