Desantisâ€™ rhetoric may change, but his policy will not. The republicans are still going to have the same agenda, Christian nationalism and legalizing their bigotry. Their Supreme Court picks will help them, we still have the upcoming decision that could entirely change election laws. This is not over yet, republicans will still be a serious threat to democracy because the only thing they care about is power, money, and enforcing their own moral code on others.
