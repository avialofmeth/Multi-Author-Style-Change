Easy - they turn them in to "others" same way they always do. They're not Israelis - they're traitors that want to destroy the Jewish people and drive us from our homeland. There's nothing new about this playbook, and fascists necessarily don't have a strong relationship with reason or truth. I'm all for supporting local elements opposing fascism, but we need to recognise the steps that are taken to prime people for genocide. Look at the rhetoric of the Republican Party for examples of the spectrum of how this is done - targeting leftists, "sexual deviants", minorities, women, the poor, etc.
