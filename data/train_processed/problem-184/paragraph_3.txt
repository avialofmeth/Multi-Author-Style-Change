You highlighted something that, now, after living half of my life as someone that called himself conservative, I just won’t do anymore. The GOP requires everyone else to know why the nonsense their spewing is bullshit. I’m done, though. I’ve resorting to cutting these people out of my life and hoping their cavalier attitudes about vaccines catch up to them. Life is too short to make any part of it about entertaining delusion.
