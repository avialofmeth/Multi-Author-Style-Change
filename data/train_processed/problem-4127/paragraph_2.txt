See the real problem here is that serial killers by and large crave the feeling of doing something illegal, the ‘power’ that comes with that. It’s highly unlikely that sanctioned killing would suit this man. he’d likely ditch to either slink into Ukraine and kill on his own OR turn back around and slink into Russia and kill people there.
