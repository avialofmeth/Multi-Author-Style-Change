I dont think they're afraid beyond they know if Trump isn't the republican nominee, he'll run as an independant and since they haven't been able to win the popular vote in a while without being at war, it'll guarantee their loss. Kind of like the house is at the whims of MGT l, Santos, and the ilk, they know their control is so tenuous they ended every last vote no matter how insane the voter is.
