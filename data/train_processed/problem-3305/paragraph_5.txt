How long do these people continue to get the benefit of the doubt? Not to be too much of an asshole here, but the GQP has been mask off for the better half of this century. They're literally running on a platform of we can do no wrong, let us overturn democratic elections, and fuck poor people, immigrants and the libs. If you vote for all of that over health care, education, a more fair tax code, and equal human rights, maybe those actually are your interests.
