But in my eyes, burning books is just a bad look. You can hate the content, and you can speak out against it. But anyone who burns a Quran, a Torah, a Bible, or any other text just makes you look like an ignorant fool. The guy who burnt the Quran in those videos this week is a total asshole, and while there are a lot of reasons to criticize Islam, that doesn’t mean he’s a good person for doing that. I mean, most people who go around burning Qurans are white supremacists, and fuck those guys. The same goes for anyone who burns a Torah. Especially someone who burns a work of art.
