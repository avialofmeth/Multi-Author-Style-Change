That's a myth. A lot of Russians still like Putin, but many of those only grudgingly so. The percent of fervent supporters is below 50%. There were significant protests at the start of the war (and periodically since 2011), which were harshly repressed by Putin's well-funded thugs. The last vestiges of independent media were also destroyed for good back then, which inhibits the protests' reporting to an extent rivalling Iran. That's also effective at making people feel isolated and alone, that their viewpoints "aren't shared by the majority".
