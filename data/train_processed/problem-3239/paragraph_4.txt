I’d like to see to see us update the tar and feathering practice to be more humane but also more humiliating. Instead of hot tar, use gorilla glue. Then, as penance, make the perp do the same walk that Cersei Lannister walk of shame. Given the girth, he will look like a sinister turkey. Then lock him up on Epstein’s island with a guard crew of wrathful old women who taunt him constantly until his final days, when he passes from this life into a hell of his own making.
