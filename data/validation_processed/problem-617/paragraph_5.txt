Care to provide some specific examples? I'll argue in Microsoft's favor for the sake of humoring it. Given that security & user learning curves were huge issues in early operating systems, I'd argue that it was appropriate to treat a user friendly backbone OS like a utility company vs. viewing it as a nefarious anti-competitive practice. A secure, user-friendly, and developer friendly is an absolutely massive untaking with the benefits from such a tech leap being absolutely massive. So finishing it ASAP should have been priority and the normal rules of capitalism don't really allow for decisions that just 'make sense'.
