That was my point...we keep blaming Trump, with good reason, but we never looked at the healthcare industry which has closed many hospitals and beds in the name of profit, which did not even have enough PPE's for healthcare workers as they went with "Just in Time" management to make more profit while we pay twice as much as most other industrialized country...if there was a time for universal healthcare, this was it...but we prefer going after an easy target instead...
