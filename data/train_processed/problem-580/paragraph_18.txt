Another example of this crime, which didn't get much attention, was Ashely Biden's diary being stolen. The people who stole it were charged with a crime because they most definitely committed one, and even went back to get more. Project Veritas is claiming that receiving stolen evidence is not atypical, and they're not wrong. However, the case may not go their way because they actively participated in a conspiracy to commit another crime in an effort to substantiate the diary itself.
