It's hard to underestimate how conservative and pious the northeasterners are. These allegations will result in entire communities rejecting the authority of the Nigerian state - which, in the northeast, is almost exclusively represented by the army outside of the major cities/state capitals. An extremely counterproductive move that will weaken Abuja's attempts to win the trust and consent to govern from the northeast population.
