I mean, they use the word ‘revive’ here, but viruses aren’t technically alive. It’s a strand of RNA inside a protein capsule that can’t move, can’t eat, can’t breathe, can’t excrete, and only can bind to a cell and trick it into incorporating it’s genetic material into its host, where it instructs the cell to replicate copies of itself.
