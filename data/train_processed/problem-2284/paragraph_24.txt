The war in Ukraine is, in it's entirety, Russia's fault. The war would never have started had it not been for Russia, and the way the war ends is if Russia pulls out of all the Ukrainian territory they seized since the Crimean invasion. NATO hasn't been expanding Eastward, especially when one recalls that Ukraine made little effort to even attempt to join NATO prior to the Crimean invasion. Similarly, NATO is a voluntary, defensive alliance. The member nations aren't forced at the end of a gun to vote to join and take part. They vote to join up BECAUSE OF certain nations invading their neighbors and forcing them to vote to become annexed, namely what Russia is doing in Ukraine.
