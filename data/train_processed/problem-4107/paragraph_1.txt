Yes, we just got fucked by those nazis wich committed 2 genocides that we know of, fucked brazilian economy (half of the population don't know if they're getting to eat anything the next day), we suffered a coup (which the US was part of), we had one of the most conturbed elections in our history; Even though Bolsonaro lost fascism grew a lot in senate and in congress; the fascists invaded the the congress, Supreme Court and the president's office (that one happened this month).
