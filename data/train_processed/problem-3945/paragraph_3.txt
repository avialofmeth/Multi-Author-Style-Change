I have little doubt that this day and age, when almost all have cell phones in our pockets, that we could come up with a way to have a secure, anonymous online way of voting. Some will probably poke holes in that idea, it's ok I didn't think too much about it. If it could be done as an option, we all know the right would block it from happening because they wouldn't win another election in many parts of the country.
