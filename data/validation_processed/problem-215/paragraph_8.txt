Also, Democrats are more than willing to compromise. Who do you see having press conferences jumpstarting conversations and urging the need to work on immigration compromise? Sen Durbin has been trying to do something for 20+ yrs. On the opposite end you have the GOP threatening to jail the DHS chief, instantly pour cold water over a bipartisan framework (i.e. John Cornyn), shutting the door on anything bipartisan, saying "my way or the highway." These two are just not the same.
