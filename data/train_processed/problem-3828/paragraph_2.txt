Half the reason they are in the position their in right now is because of them trying to hack US servers and interfeiring with elections. I'm sure the reason we are supporting Ukraine at the level we are is to teach them a lesson. Sort of a fuck around and find out type of situation. US has been looking for a way to retaliate effectively and Russia put right out there for us. Hopefully they get the memo and quit their hacking schnanigans.
