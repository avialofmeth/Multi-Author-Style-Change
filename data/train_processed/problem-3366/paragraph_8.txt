It's a small township but part of a large metro sprawl that stretches north of Youngstown in Mahoning County on down through to Columbia County where East Palestine is, and west towards the Akron-Canton area. It's not the middle of the Ghobi Desert or some isolated rural bumkin town. Well water is not going to be common there at all.
