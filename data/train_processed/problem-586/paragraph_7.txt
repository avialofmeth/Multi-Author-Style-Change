Ah yeah, not punishing the users, providing clean options for existing addicts, injecting rooms etc… I find that all fairly common senses tbh it was only the idea of a heroine shop, that took it too far for me. As for the illegal drug trade … yeah for me you can only reduce that by reducing the number of addicts tbh. So anything that helps support people off opioids is great, but anything that incoursges people to try them… yeah I just can’t shake the opioid crisis lesson tbh.
