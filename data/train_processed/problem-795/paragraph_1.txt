pretty much all the brands who said they left russia are still doing business with russia don't kid yourself... just using shell companies and different brand name... you can still find addidas, Nike, the latest iphone, french cosmetics, etc... so i really doubt this list is even accurate, if there is money to be made they will find a way to grab it.
