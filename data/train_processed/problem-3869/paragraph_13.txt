Its an absolute mess. When feds, lawyers, state govts, local communities, and farmers and ignorant environmentalists and homeowners all along and across the 7 states that feed and use water from the Colorado, all start speaking and protesting... nothing much will change fast to solve that problem at the end of the line and just like prosecuting 45....many of us will all be dead of old age before anything is resolved.
