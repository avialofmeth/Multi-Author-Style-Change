If someone tried to draft me against my will I'd comply up to the point my life was placed in any danger then I'd either find the highest ranking officer I could or the biggest asshole and put two rounds in the back of their head and spend the rest of the war in a prison cell. No one is forcing me to fight against my will, its not even possible and the only thing you should feel for the person who tries is pity.
