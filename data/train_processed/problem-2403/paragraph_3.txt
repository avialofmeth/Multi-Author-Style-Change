Are they pro-Russian or just the isolationist types who don't want money spent on behalf of anybody else? I don't know that I've met anybody who is pro-Russian, but I have met some people who think we shouldn't send money or resources to other countries. Not saying that's OK, just asking out of curiosity when I see such stats.
