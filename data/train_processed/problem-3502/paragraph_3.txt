Depends in how healthy the economy/ business are. If a lot of business leave/ close then unemployment is going to go up. Yes, the military, and those that left the county will reduce the amount of available people. But if the unemployment numbers are still rising then it implies that their economy is starting to feel the war/ sanctions.
