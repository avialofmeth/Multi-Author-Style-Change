Tomorrow tricks will be learned on the systems of today, higher quality datasets and tagging will be used (go look at the LAION dataset and wonder just how it's able to make responses as good as they are now) new compositional techniques developed (I want a sun here, mountains here, forest here etc... I want a blue goat standing on a red car).
