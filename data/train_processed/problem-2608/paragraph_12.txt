No the deal wasn't with gazprom. The deal was actually with a Singaporean subsidiary, which was owned by the German subsidiary, which was owned by gazprom. But after the war, the German government nationalized the German subsidiary, and now are thus the indirect owners of the singaporean subsidiary. That's why there is an issue, because the Indian government expects the subsidiary with which it originally made the deal, to uphold the deal, regardless of who owns it.
