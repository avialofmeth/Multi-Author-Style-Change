I'm not sure, but it seems to me that western Europe is concerned with keeping the peace after war and are less inclined to see Russia wiped out economically and militarily. But perhaps there are many in the American Government who would love to see Russia destroyed and unable to recover. They've noticed this is Russia's last chance to fight a major war. Indications are that due to the appallingly low birthrate in Russia, this is the last generation where Russia will have sufficient males of fighting age to fight their usual tactics of war of attrition. After this war, Russia has 20 years left before they have so few young males that war is off the table and the dream of greater Russia is gone forever.
