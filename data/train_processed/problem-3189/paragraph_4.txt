If you want to know why she hasn't named the person just watch the latest interview with Louis Theroux. She says I've got a family and a mortgage and I'm not going to risk being able to pay my mortgage to name the guy who has lots of money in power and could sue her. Unfortunately this is the way that it is in this industry until enough people come together.... why do you think people like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein got away with it for so long.
