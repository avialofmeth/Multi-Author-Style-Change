Then you run into millions of cases where the utility simply won't allow it, even if you do actually come through with funding. Electric grid infrastructure is a mess. A serious mess. Capacity is already exceeded in many locales, so adding 100% of the driving public's electric car usage is probably not feasible. And I don't see one party allowing infrastructure upgrades any time soon.
