Conservatives and libertarians (we’ll pick on them later), are the sheep of our entire society and humanity at large. They get a lil and feel like the in group and are constantly scared someone is going to take it from them. They are the sheeple that they keep trying to convince the rest of us we are. They have no convictions other than what their overlords tell them, they cannot critique themselves because they do not understand nuance or that this isn’t a team sport and they are ready to throw away yesterday’s ideology as long as it gets them a win.
