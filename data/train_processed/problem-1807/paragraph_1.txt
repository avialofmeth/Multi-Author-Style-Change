Please show examples of Iranian protesters calling for America to invade. Just because they dislike their government doesn’t mean they’d support a foreign army invading their country. Half the US population was very unhappy with the last US administration, nobody called for Canada to invade. You have a very simplistic view of the world if you think armed invasion is the answer to civil issues in a sovereign nation.
