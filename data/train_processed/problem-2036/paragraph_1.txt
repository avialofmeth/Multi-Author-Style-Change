Republicans are a big tent party of people who want to go back in time. Some of them want the Leave it to Beaver 1950s fantasy world. Some of them want to bring back the Gilded Age and laissez-faire capitalism. Others still want to go back to the 1850s when they could literally own the libs. And then there are a few like Alito who want to go back to the 1600s.
