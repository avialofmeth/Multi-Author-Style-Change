Personally, I am hoping that we can develop hyper persuasive AI systems that will be able to remove beliefs from people with relative ease. People only believe the religious stuff because it was programmed into them from external sources. There is no doubt that there is a reliable way to overwrite these types of beliefs and we should be able to develop chatGPT like bots that can figure out what inputs would be necessary to break these people free from the nonsense.
