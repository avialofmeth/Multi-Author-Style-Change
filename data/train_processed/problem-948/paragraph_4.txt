As for Rafale in Europe, they get the (shitty) Eurofighter and the US nuke umbrella included with the F23 so... That sounds logical to go for the F23 (our own nuke umbrella is kinda tiny in comparison). Now, Germany killing common programs on a regular basis is a problem, hope the next gen plane won't end up the same way.
