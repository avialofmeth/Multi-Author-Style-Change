The problem is that there's no clear definition of who counts as a whistleblower and how to protect them against legal action from their employer (which could also be the government). The law was written with Snowden in mind, not some guy at VW who notices his company cheating emissions tests. There's also no clear way for whistleblowers to get their information out without breaking other laws (like data privacy or treason). And last but not least: companies can still fire you for being a whistleblower if they want to - it just has to go through an arbitration process first. Which means you'll lose your job either way unless you have enough money saved up for a lawyer.
