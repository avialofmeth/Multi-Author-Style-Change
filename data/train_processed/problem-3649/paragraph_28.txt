- I’m no weapons expert, but my understanding of the situation is that there was somewhat of a delay getting Ukrainians training on Western systems. The initial priority was on legacy Eastern bloc stuff because it was already nearby and Ukrainians knew how to use it. That made sense in the early stages of the war, but I get the impression that the implementation of western systems could have been done faster and more effectively. Precision artillery has seemingly been a game changer. Not really sure what other options are available that haven’t been explored yet.
