And yes, I know some people will say "but what about their families?" Well firstly, most of them aren't married or have kids so that argument is null and void for most of them anyway Secondly, if you want to help their families then go help their families Don't join a terrorist group because you think it'll somehow help your family in some way That's selfish as hell Go help your family yourself instead of joining an organization whose only goal is death on a massive scale for everyone involved!
