It's very hard to understand what word "support the war means". Lets look at the example. I am Ivan and I don't support war. And my neighbor vlad supports war and even tatooed big fat letter Z on his left arm. I work for respectible company and I publically say that I don't support war (in fac I do not support war, I strongly believe it could have been avoided). However I pay more in taxes per month then some people make in a year and my friend Vlad, who wears big Z don't even have a job. Now suddenly despite whatever I say or state I am actually very tangibly support war with actual money, where my friend is just a dead weight. Support is relative. And wearing certain flag has nothing to do it.
