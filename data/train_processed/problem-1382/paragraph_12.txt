Haiti had an extremely tumultuous history since the very beginning, in large part due to having to pay reparations and being treated like a pariah state. But another part of it was that their political system has been dominated by dictators and strongmen and outright maniacs since independence. Aristide, despite all his flaws, was one of the most competent leaders Haiti ever had along with René Préval. The country has also been extremely unlucky in other ways, including with the 2010 earthquake.
