It's like there is still a debate going on whether Russia is doing something illegal or it's completely fine to invade your neighbor, expand own territories by force, level entire cities to the ground, kidnap children, forcibly relocate tens of thousands of people, bomb the crap out of civilian infrastructure etc. And these are just things Russia has admitted themselves.
