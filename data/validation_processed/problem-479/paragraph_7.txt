Missouri passed it by referendum about 4-6 years ago, I think? Then at the next election Repubs put a very confusing ballot measure to get rid of it. They promoted it as “getting rid of money in politics” by lowering the amount state legislators could take in gifts from lobbyists. What they didn’t say was that it only lowered the amount by $5. ( And by the way, it moves redistricting back to the state legislature. But that was never mentioned in any ads about it).
