The more countries that have nukes the higher the likelihood they will be used which could result in a full on exchange of nuclear weapons between two countries and thus nuclear winter. There have already been several close calls between the US and USSR so adding more to the party only makes the entire world more dangerous. Totalitarian governments are also inherently more risky because your putting these weapons in the hands of one or a small number of people that can make these disastrous decisions. What if the dictator is paranoid, depressed, becomes mentally unstable? Clearly the world is full of irrational actors. Thereâ€™s also the possibility of Iran selling nuclear weapons to allies or terrorist groups. And whose to stop them if the end result is nuclear exchange?
