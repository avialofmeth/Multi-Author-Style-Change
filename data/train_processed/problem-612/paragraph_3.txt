If you want to think about it like an org chart, if Biden woke up today and said, "you know what, screw Apple, I want the CEO gone, I want them to move all their production to America, I want my face to come pre-loaded as the lock screen image" can he pull that off? No, not a chance. If Putin wanted the equivalent from Gazprom? One phone call and every barrel of oil will have his face on the side and the CEO will fall out of a window onto seven bullets that just so happened to have been laying on the cement facing up exactly where he fell.
