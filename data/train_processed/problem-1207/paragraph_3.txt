Tell me how many of those universities truly matter? Cause I am certain that the top 100-1000 universities contribute far more Papers than the rest of the 24000 that exist on Earth. The fact that much of this information is digitised means that it would be far easier to make this information accesible, Now I do aknowledge that you most certainly can't become a PhD Student without mentorship this I concede that Universities should still exist. But I do believe that the Monopoly of Scientific knowledge that Universities have should be broken.
