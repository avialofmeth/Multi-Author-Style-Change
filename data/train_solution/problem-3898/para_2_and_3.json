    "feature1": {
        "explanation": "Both texts use hyphens, colons, and commas in a similar manner. However, only Paragraph 1 contains parentheses, while Paragraph 2 does not. This slight difference in punctuation usage may suggest a potential variance in writing style.",

        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 has longer and more complex sentences compared to Paragraph 2.
