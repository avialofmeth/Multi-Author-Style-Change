I'm from Tennessee and hate hogs as much as the next guy, but to be fair they made the wording of all those amendments purposefully obtuse and confusing in my opinion. We had another amendment on weakening unions, and my absolutely prounion mother voted in favor of it thinking she was voting against it. Not to excuse all 20% but at least a portion of them.
