Not the same path as you but a similar end road. Look at it this way. Nothing holding you back from doing new things now. No bullshit like “nah man that’s stupid I don’t want to go do (insert activity)”. You are all in the clear to meet new people and do the things you want to try. Kinda liberating what you look at the opportunities.
