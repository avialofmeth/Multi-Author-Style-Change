In PPP adjusted terms, Russia has a per capita GDP (not a national GDP) comparable to Kazakhstan or Venezuela. And that was before the Ukranian war and all its devastation. Probably also before oligarchs siphon off most of the money. I doubt they can even change the bulbs in the streetlights. Putin is probably talking out his ass like all the other times.
