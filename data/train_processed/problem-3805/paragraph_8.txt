I'm not talking about the Mullahs themselves, I'm talking about their thugs. And they are roaming with impunity, they're not being shot in the streets and beaten by mobs of hundreds of people. The average Iranian citizens outnumber those thugs the Mullahs use to maintain control many times over, yet they still roam freely, beating and arresting people, executing teenagers, and shooting kids in front of their parents. Iranians have a lot more to do to get invested enough in this situation if they want any actual change. Unrest and riots against the Mullahs has happened before, and was eventually squashed before, and that is just repeating itself with better news coverage this time.
