Most of my family and alot of friends are conservative, we were always able to get together and share holidays ect, even enjoyed some political banter. Now? Not a chance, no attempt at agree to disagree or changing the subject. It's all consumimg, facts became opinions they feel they disagree with and are not happy unless everyone is sitting around nodding their heads at how evil the left is.
