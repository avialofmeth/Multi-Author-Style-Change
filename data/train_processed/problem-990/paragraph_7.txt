I do not think Putin would give his blessing to Prigozhin who is popular with Ultranationalists, who haven't always been too kind to Putin and been pressuring the guy to nuke and takeover territories of former Soviet states and former Russian imperial lands. He may have Putin's ear and be his "friend" but in the end he is competition and no dictator especially as paranoid as Putin would have endless trust.
