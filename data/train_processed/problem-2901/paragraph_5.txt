I'm Russian and I can tell it IS used as a propaganda tool, but it seems for me it's more because Russian Athletes are being denied. I don't care about sports much at all but now all I hear is how evil west is denying Russian Athletes and barring them from competition. I can't imagine how can this measure help except to alienate Russian public from the west more and help Russian propaganda. I'm strongly against collective responsibility. I mean it's fine if you deny war participants or famous politicians, forbid political statements during competitions, but just for being Russian? I don't understand that.
