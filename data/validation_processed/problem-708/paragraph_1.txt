Why should it feel bad? If Republicans reshaped their policies to shit I liked or were any good at all then I'd vote for them. But they don't, can't, and won't. They don't even try. It's mask off. And until trans rights rights secured federally I will never vote for them. The dems seriously try my fucking patience every election promising better rights and protections for lgbt people and never delivering a single fucking time at the federallevel. Do you have any idea how easy my vote would be to steal if a party promised and delivered that? I hate both of them just the dems less because at least they pretend to care when they lie to my face.
