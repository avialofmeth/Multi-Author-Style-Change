Chinese government needs to show bravado in front of its people. It's part of their schtick: "You may be poor and living a shitty life but your country's super amazing and beat the crap out of other countries." We are talking about a country whose state news agency's nightly news would update US covid death count each day just to show how how successful their zero covid policy has been. And will always repeat over and over how they have the 2nd highest GDP in the world.
