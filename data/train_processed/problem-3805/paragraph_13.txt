Iran is also one of the few countries in the world where the regime over it's 43 hear rule has legalized child executions by hanging (having hung two teenagers for consensual gay sex around 2017), and legalised child marriage for girls as young as 9 during their brutal reign. Khomeini's tahrir al wasilah also rules that it is permissable to rape girls as young as 9 and to sexually assault without intercourse girls even younger than that. Children aren't safe at the hands of the Iranian regime, nobody is safe from the regime.
