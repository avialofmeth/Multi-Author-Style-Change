It's been interesting watching Shapiro decry Kanye's antisemitism while still trying to ride the narrow ledge between that and criticizing the people whose financial support he now depends on. Dude played himself trying to be "one of the good ones" and it's becoming more and more obvious how much of a mistake that was. My ideal world is he cracks under the insane pressures of the world he built for himself and does a complete 180 on his political stances but I know better than to hope for that.
