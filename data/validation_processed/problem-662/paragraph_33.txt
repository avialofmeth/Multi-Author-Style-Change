Yes it is. Of course, if you enacted a policy that killed millions of people, you will have almost certainly committed a long list of other crimes for which you will die in prison. A large number of murders, if, say, you wanted them to die but not because of their membership of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Iâ€™m not sure what the international equivalent of gross negligence resulting in death is, but that would be a distinct possibility.
