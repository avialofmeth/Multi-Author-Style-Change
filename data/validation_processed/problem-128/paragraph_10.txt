Jiang (and all Chinese leaders) are not afraid of religious movements in general, they are afraid of any institution that threatens the CPC's authority over China. Most sects of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity are tolerated, as long as they keep they promise to never question the CPC or discuss political issues. Tibetan Buddhism and Islam in Xinjiang were suppressed because they were afraid of separatist movements. Jehovah's Witness was banned because it taught its followers to refuse to swear allegiance to a specific nation. However, Hui Islam, Mahayana Buddhism, and the Catholic Patriotic Association are tolerated because they don't conflict with the CPC's political agenda.
