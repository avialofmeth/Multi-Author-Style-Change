    "feature1": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 uses apostrophes in contractions like 'it's' and quotation marks around the word 'facts'. There are no other punctuation marks like hyphens, brackets, colons, commas, or parentheses used in either text.",

    },
    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit some informal language choices and slight deviations from standard grammar, such as 'bonafide', 'probem', 'bonifide', 'it's'. These choices could be indicative of a similar writing style.",

    },
    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "Both texts contain short and straightforward sentences with a conversational tone. Paragraph 1 has a slightly higher sentence complexity due to the use of the term 'bonafide reporters'. Overall, the sentence structure and quantitative features show some similarity.",

    },
    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 adopts a slightly more formal tone related to news reporting, while the second text is more direct and transactional as it is an automated response. Despite the differences in content, there are elements of common expression in the informal style of both texts.",
