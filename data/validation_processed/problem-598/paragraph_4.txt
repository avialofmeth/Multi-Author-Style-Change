In my defense, I was only considering it this year because I was really not doing great mentally a few months back and the effort involved(little as it was) just seemed too much to bother for how little my 1 ballot would actually help. Still not doing great tbh but I had to do my part for women's rights on principle even if my part didn't really affect anything.
