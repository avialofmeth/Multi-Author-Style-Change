if we start rolling up every mother fucker that stands around watching a murder we might start seeing some progress. At this point I've come to view the cops that watch the murdering as worse than the ones actually murdering. it's the watchers that enable the murders and its the "good" cops that can stop this shit, but they choose not to.
