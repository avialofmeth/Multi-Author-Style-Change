This critical point could be people starting to die in droves because they simply can't afford to live. It could be that this situation causes permenant severe mental and physical health issues for a very significant portion of the population, which cuts down the national life expectancy, results in overall loss of productivity and a permanent dependency on welfare (I'd argue we're already here with this one). It could even be people responding to policy decisions with violence and an overall hostile and aggressive attitude is developed towards politics and politicians.
