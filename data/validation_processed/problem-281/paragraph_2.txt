Literally hundreds to thousands of people go to that zoo and see them everyday. And they take just as many pictures. The American people would be outraged if they actually saw animal abuse at a zoo so no way this would have been allowed to continue. Just think of how upset people off when they had to shoot Harambe a few years ago because they thought they were saving a childâ€™s life.
