There's a Ukrainian charity in Czech republic that operates out of a clothing store , and they stitch warm clothing for the Ukrainian military/ civilians. Their Instagram is @volunteers_cz. They have a PayPal that accepts donation , if you check out their Instagram, i think you'll have a good idea of what they do , i hope you decide to donate through them !
