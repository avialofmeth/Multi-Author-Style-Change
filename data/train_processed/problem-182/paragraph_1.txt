California is not the progressive paradise you seem to think it is. The insanely inflated housing prices in the big cities have given everyone fortunate enough to own a house neoliberal brain poisoning which leads to them opposing anything that would help other people. They do this because they care about others and they don't want to hurt anybody but their own capital is more important. It also has the most hate groups per Capita last time I checked.
