I work for a Norwegian company that has maritime and military branches. Within the first month of the war, the stock price skyrocketed. Like from 120 NOK to 340 NOK. It was insane. Cruel, but it was really beneficial for those who were in employee stock program. My friend sold most of his stock and payed 3/4 of his mortgage.
