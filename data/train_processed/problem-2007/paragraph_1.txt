The long awaited next big missile strike finally happened and it really wasn’t anything special, the number of missiles that was expected was vastly overblown, as it wasn’t the 120+ missiles that everyone was talking about, but only 69 and some Shaheds along with them. It doesn’t seem that it did too much damage to our infrastructure, the problems with electricity are not widespread right now, and some blackouts are not due to the missile strike, but because some cities turned off electricity as preventive measures to lessen any possible damage.
