As an American in a same-sex marriage with a Russian, this is very depressing. We have family in Russia who we very much want to see. The war is currently making that something we won't be doing until at least that is over (let's hope with Ukraine successfully defending freedom). Now this law makes it difficult to see family there even after the war. It sounds like just acknowledging that we exist is now illegal.
