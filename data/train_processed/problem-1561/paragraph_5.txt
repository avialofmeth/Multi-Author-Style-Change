Ronald Reagan was a racist who told Nixon he didn’t like the UN because, in his words, the African delegates seemed like monkeys who didn’t know how to wear shoes. He began his campaign with a states rights speech at the site of a famous lynching. He ended school desegregation (with the support of blue dog democrats such as Senator Joe Bide). And while he may have offered amnesty he began the more modern conservative approach to the southern border aiming to deport migrant workers. Also Iran contra. Also all the other things he did in Latin America. Also the War on Drugs. He welcomed dictators to the White House and supported them all over the world.
