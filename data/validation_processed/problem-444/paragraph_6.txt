Lol that foro de Sao Paulo. It doesn't say who signed it besides I'm talking about what you said about all the left in South America supports Russia which is bullshit. Yeah Lula was wrong in some statements but that doesn't affect me. You keep the classic far-right retoric that all leftist governments are pro-russian when it isn't. And why would they support the U.S when we all know the history of them internvining in the continent to place dictators and affecting democracy.
