It's a lot more than that. Ukraine estimates 120,000 killed on the Russia side. If you include wounded we're talking 3x that number. They already burned through 500,000 men on the Russian side. The cold and mud has also created a ton of none combat casualties. That's why the Russians are calling up another 1.5 million men. Unfortunately for them their equipment situation is bleak so they are gonna be sent into a meat grinder while the Ukrainian side is well equipped just lacking in ammunition. Ukraine has so many volunteers that they are turning people away.
