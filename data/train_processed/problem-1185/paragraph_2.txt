I quite enjoyed the read, however I think it's very important to note that Tolkien himself in his preface of the Lord of the Rings states that “I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.".
