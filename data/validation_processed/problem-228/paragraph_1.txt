They aren't very clear on how far this goes. Its illegal to smoke on beaches and parks here in Canada, at least in the city where I live, Ottawa. There is no law against smoking on the sidewalk, but you can't smoke within 9 metres of a bus stop or a bunch of other publicly owned facilities. You can't smoke on outdoor restaurant patios.
