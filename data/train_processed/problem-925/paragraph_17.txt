I think that the answer is yes, but French people are still wondering how the same country could elect and re-elect Barack Obama and then put Donald Trump in the White House. American democracy was also seen as rock-solid before this unconventional mandate, which is not the case anymore (French people donâ€™t consider their democracy to be stable anymore either, by the way).
