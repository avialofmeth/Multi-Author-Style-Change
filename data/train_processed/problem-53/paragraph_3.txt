I’ll honestly keep paying for dental and vision without complaining about it if we could just get basic universal health care. Generally, there’s not going to be a sudden dental emergency that financially ruins you so long as you’re practicing good hygiene and getting your exams and cleanings regularly, and eye exams and glasses are very affordable without insurance of any sort.
