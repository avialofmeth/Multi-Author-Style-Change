While I think Russia’s self-maintained image as a bulwark against western colonialism is laughable at best (it wasn’t for lack of trying and Russia also swallowed the entirety of Eastern Europe and many Asian nations around it), I wish these countries understood what a pathetic bet Russia is. Economically, its partners tend to do very poorly (Cuba, Venezuela, SA, Syria, etc) and don’t seem to benefit much from the relationship, and militarily we’ve seen that Russia is at best a third rate regional power that got lucky by having nukes. Basically Russia is little more than a European Pakistan. And, if after Ukraine, you think Russia’s military is going to intimidate the West…well, I don’t really know what to tell you. At least China I can understand from an economic perspective, but Russia could barely compete with individual U.S. states, much less superpowers. If you want your foreign policy to solely be about being anti-westernism at the expense of technology, growth and wealth, I guess knock yourself out with Russia.
