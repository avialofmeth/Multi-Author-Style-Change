I mean you should always keep negotiating and diplomacy avenues available even if neither party is willing to participate in good faith. Also have a good idea what peace really means because you can say you want xyz but do you have the power to get it all or are you willing to negotiate the terms of defeat. Aka Ukraine can win all the land back but doesn't have the forces to make Moscow payfor the economic impact.
