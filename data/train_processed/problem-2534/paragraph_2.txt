Kind of the problem with modern press. They rely heavily on "unnamed officials" and "unnamed sources" to print stories. The chances of these unnamed sources being either made up.... or simply being wrong is high. Not every single government official who hears rumors and rumblings inside government represents the actual stance of the state.
