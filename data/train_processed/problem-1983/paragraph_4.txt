In our community, there's a collaborative program between hunters, meat processors, and food banks. Hunters donate a deer/antelope/elk/etc, a certified facility processes it, and food banks can offer it to their clients. I benefitted from the program when I was struggling, and I was so grateful Plus, you get to skip the whole factory farming piece. Full bellies. Better environmental stewardship. It's a win/win.
