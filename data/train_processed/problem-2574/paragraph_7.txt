I think you forgot how conservative that area is - itâ€™s a suburban Long Island district that is 70% white, and was represented for decades by Peter King, who was a Trumpian even before Trump, and supported Trump (after leaving Congress). Yes redistricting made the seat more of a contest and Souzzi held it for a bit but not enough to make it stay blue.
