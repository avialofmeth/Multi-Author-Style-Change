"the eu has maintained a ban if import of beef from cattle because if growth hormones ... In 2009 eu and USA came to an agreement after eu refuses to remove the ban in the hormones" now bio beef from natural greoth can be traded with eu but the ban in the "normal" ones continue as the used hormones are all banned in the eu. Pork ban is based on a other medicament that is also banned in eu. It was all decades after mad cow. NOTHING is proven false i have no idea what ur talking about. The hormones are still banned in 2009 we made a deal about 17thousend tons of non hormon treated beef.
