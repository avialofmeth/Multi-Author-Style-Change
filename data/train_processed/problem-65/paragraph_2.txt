Yeah but why would we? Last I checked we are sitting at 1 million refugees and like 400 tanks sent to Ukraine. Feel free to deliver an aircraft carrier filled to brim with strategic bombers if you think it can pass through our borders and can help in beating Russia. Absolutely nobody would oppose the idea and you probably could even do it without anyone finding out until it's already in use (Polish forums specifically tell people NOT TO share any pics/videos of anything military related that goes to Ukraine).
