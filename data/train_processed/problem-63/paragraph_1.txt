Yeah but we knew the mirror was 1.2 m same as Hubble and the max resolution that can do is like 10 cm. So he only confirmed what everyone knew. Scott Manley has a great video on it, he and some others actually work out the time and angle and which satellite it was. The Keyhole satellites are basically Hubble chassis but with near sighted lenses as opposed to NASA. NRO gifted NASA two of them some years back one is now WFIRST.
