You are so right. It’s stuff like ”No matter what you’re doing, here’s why you’re being fooled” type of headlines that make me hate a lot of media. No one’s take ever seems to be “yeah, that’s a reasonable reaction for the population to have.” A lot of this was in the Trump years, where if headlines were getting clicks we were all eating up his tricks but if we weren’t then we were overwhelmed and tired of paying attention. So frustrating.
