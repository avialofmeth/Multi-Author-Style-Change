As a swede, the guy Rasmus Paludan is a half-danish racist white supremacist. His whole thing is trying to upset muslims by burning their holy book in hopes they get violent, so he can point at them and go "Islam is a religion of violence!". He is doing it outside turkish embassy because with the current climate he KNOWS it will get more attention and possibly get Sweden in trouble, which is good for him because he hates Sweden.
