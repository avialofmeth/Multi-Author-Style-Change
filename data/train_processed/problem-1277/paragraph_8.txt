Except it isn't just the salary. Without a non-compete a sales person could walk to a competing company for the same salary with a one time "bonus" because he has all the competitions contacts. Possibly putting one company out of business and many people out of work. Now I agree that non-competes are over used and many are illegal. But in some cases they are needed.
