This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance. The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office. Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired. Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
