Sometimes, the sealing bags failed. Seams get broken. Driving the multi-tonne vehicle a little too roughly over the bag might have caused a tear. A bit of metal sticking out from vehicle might poke a small hole in the bag (Seen it happen once or twice with an antenna stub or a weapon mount). Wild animals, even rats, can somehow bite through the thick bag material.
