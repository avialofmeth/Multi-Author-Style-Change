Those helping to arm Ukraine are wary that their weapons be used for offense rather than defense, where that line lies. German tanks (meaning tanks supplied by Germany, not necessarily operated by them) rolling through Red Square would be touchy. I'm not opposing more and more capable weaponry being supplied. Just saying there's a reason countries are a little cautious.
