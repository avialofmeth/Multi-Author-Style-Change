While you're not wrong, the problem in a situation like this is that if a group of soldiers surrenders there's a very good chance that anyone else who saw it happen will follow suit. Equally true if you're in battle or as here with a group of soldiers just bolting from their positions outside of combat. Then while you're costing the enemy resources to take care of those surrendered troops, you've also lost pretty much an entire combat unit. And there's the risk that if other units of questionable morale hear about it they might follow suit, and then you don't have an army to fight your war any more.
