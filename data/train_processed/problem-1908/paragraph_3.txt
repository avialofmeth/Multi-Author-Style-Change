As the other poster wrote, there are types of lines you can build to reduce these losses which are already all over the western US. Eg, in the 80s they build the Intermountain Power Project, which is a big coal plant in the middle of the Utah desert that runs power lines to Los Angeles. I always wondered why they don't just cover the area with solar panels, since it's mostly desert scrub used for sheep and cattle grazing. However, after a quick wiki search, it looks like they are tearing down the coal plant and building a natural gas plant in its place that will (eventually) use solar to produce hydrogen for the plant to burn. That latter part could just be hogwash the company used to greenlight the natural gas plant, but they are building solar panels too, so hopefully that part will expand over time.
