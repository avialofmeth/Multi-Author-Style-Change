That’s the funny thing. There actually is quite a few, but they’re mostly studying at satellite campuses of US universities (for example, NYU and Duke have campuses in China) or joint teaching programs where you’re physically on the campus of a Chinese university but your classes are taught in English by a mix of US and local university faculty, you’re legally treated as attending the US one, and you get a US degree in the end (University of Michigan-SJTU program). Very very few Americans or Canadians attend purely Chinese universities for degree programs.
