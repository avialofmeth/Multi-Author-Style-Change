Honestly alot of people are struggling for the basic necessities, with the news gloating CEO profits daily. Did you know that the reason UPS doesn't have A/C in their vans is because it would cost them an extra $185 per truck, and dozens of workers have died of heat stroke? Honestly if things don't change soon the law won't matter people will get fed up.
