Yes this is true, from what I understand as well. If Ukraine can cut off the land bridge that Putin has so far held onto, the only way to resupply Crimea is over Kerch Straight Bridge, which has already been bombed once...or by ferry, which from a logistics standpoint, cannot replace a bridge or land crossing. Also, the main water supply to all of Crimea can be dammed as well (Ukraine already did this before when Putin annexed Crimea) effectively cutting off Crimea from all food, water, and weapons resupply. It would essentially become an island with no food, water, weapons, or any kind of resupply. Not an ideal position to be defending from.
