Human psychology. We tend to be our happiest when we've got someone to follow, someone to walk beside, and someone to walk on. The last part is something more progressive societies at least (in theory) try to prevent, but when the government walks on you with cleated shoes, then the easiest way to feel like you've got any control and power in your life at all is to find someone even less fortunate to grind into mud with your heel. In Russia, through all of its incarnations, but especially the Soviet days and modern Russia, the latter's incentivised. You're not going to rise up against your overlords when you're too busy being afraid of, or tormenting your next door neighbour, or even your own family.
