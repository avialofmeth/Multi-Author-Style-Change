So was I? Saying that India is funding Russia is like spitting in the ocean and saying that it’s making ocean levels rise. Russia is barely making profit from the discounted oil that they’re selling to India. When you throw in all the sanctions from other countries, it hardly makes a difference what India is doing. It can’t even compare to the amount Russia made off Europe for so many years.
