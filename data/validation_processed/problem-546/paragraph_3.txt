There isn’t enough water in the ice caps to completely submerge all continents, a vast majority of the U.S. and other continents would still have plenty of land… however it would swallow up entire coastal cities and impact the densest areas of population on the planet. It would be an apocalyptic scenario for some regions having to relocate but not a water world. For instance the entire state of Florida would pretty much be swallowed up, but we aren’t looking at living on islands that used to be mountain ranges for most of humanity.
