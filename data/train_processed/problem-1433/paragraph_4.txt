There is such a bad stigma around pitbulls that they are often unwanted/discriminated against, a byproduct of this is that they are the most common dog found at shelters. Now that they are the most common and affordable dog, a lot of the adopters aren't going to do any proper training. Some of those untrained dogs will go right back to the shelter willy nilly because there wasn't much of an investment to adopt them to begin with. It's really a vicious cycle.
