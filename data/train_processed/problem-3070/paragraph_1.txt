Considering there is debate about if ruzzia has actually launched their much anticipated renewed offensive or not, it might very well be just the face of the most pathetic offensive of all time. We'll have to wait and see, but if russia doesn't move before Ukraine counterattack starts, it's really not going to look good for them.
