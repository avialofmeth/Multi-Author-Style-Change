The concession to build the park was given in 2010 by NVE. This was during the Stoltenberg goverment(Workersparty/Arbeiderpartiet). So blaming the whole "mess" on "the last goverment" is incorrect. Under the Solberg goverments(Right/HÃ¸yre); Building started in 2015 and the park was fully operational in 2020.
