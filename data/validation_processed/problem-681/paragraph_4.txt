The people here, this kind of congregation for example, are bombarded with scary stories from right-wing media constantly. They listen to it on their drive to work (the 1 radio station in the state has a morning show that is very right-wing), they talk about it with their co-workers during the day, they listen to it on their drive home, they watch it on the TV over dinner, and at night they read about it on their phone before they fall asleep.
