Bit of a sensational headline. It’s true Iran has made the maximum sentence for being involved in this death. And that is all kinds of messed up yes, but to jump from that to “Iran is going to executer 15,000 people!” isn’t logical. Of the people tried so far only one person has been sentenced to death, the rest were sentenced to jail time. The person sentenced to death wasn’t shouting a slogan or participating in a march, they were convicted of setting fire to a government building. Again, that’s a f’d up thing to sentence someone to death for and these murderers in power deserve all of your anger, but it still doesn’t mean 15,000 students are going to be executed. I think we can hate Iran’s leaders and expect accurate reporting at the same time.
