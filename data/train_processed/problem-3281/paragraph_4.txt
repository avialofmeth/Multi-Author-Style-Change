2020 Republicans picked up 14 House seats, and it can be argued that they lost the Senate thanks to the Tremendous Orange Bloviator going on, and on, and on about the stolen election; also, Trump lost the presidency all on his own, and no possible RNC chair could have made him change anything he did. Republicans maintained majorities in enough state legislatures for redistricting that you just can't call 2020 a disaster.
