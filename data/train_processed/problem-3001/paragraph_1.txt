It depends. While you assume because the news uses it, it'll stay, you also fail to realize as of now it's losing even more money than before when it was already operating at a loss. And you may be correct if it can continue operating at a loss long enough for people to move on to the next thing then maybe advertisers will come back and Twitter will be back to a normal thing but if any app starts to gain traction and taking people who have already left the platform and enticing others from Twitter to join, I think that spells an end to Twitter and news outlets will just jump to that. However that app hasn't been made yet so as of now it's just watching the fallout and seeing how it all plays out.
