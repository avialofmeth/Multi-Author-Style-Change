In the grand scheme of things, however, it could be a net positive for the world (Western, especially). A semi-demilitarised Russia can attempt another invasion again within a decade. One which has sacrificed nearly all of its arsenal and a big chunk of its young population will have a harder time ever rebounding to its prewar level of power. Thus, another two years of war might permanently remove Russia as a significant geopolitical player altogether.
