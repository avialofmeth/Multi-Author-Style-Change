My wife is Chinese and has told me about the type of dog that is farmed there and how she has eaten them. This made me question why I think eating that is worse than eating something like a pig which is arguably more intelligent. I cannot come up with any reasons why eating dogs is worse than eating pigs. I eat neither, but I cannot argue why one is better than the other.
