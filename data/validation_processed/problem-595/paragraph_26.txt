IIRC, that’s always consistently been India’s stance, though. It doesn’t want internationalization of any of its disputes and sticks to the “bilateral” route. But I think China’s constant provocations and territory grabs (it has territorial disputes with EIGHTEEN countries, for crying out land) have made at least a superficial cozying up to Japan/Aus/the U.S. tactically desirable for India. The U.S should (subtly and in private) push that advantage.
