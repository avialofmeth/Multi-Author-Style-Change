Some of my family still lives in the district and told me they literally saw zero ads for Daniels the entire race but did see some for Perry. (By contrast at least one every commercial break for the Senate and Governors race.) It would make a world of difference if people from the broader Democratic party put more pressure on the state party to focus on this race and put the spotlight on how terrible Perry actually is.
