You really want to tell the hedge fund that they can't judge potential investments by criteria that effects their bottom line? Fink isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart, not to solve the world's problems and not to drive some liberal agenda, he's doing it because companies that get with the program provide a better risk profile (and thus safer returns) compared to companies with similar balance sheets that don't.
