Election officials are just not happy about having to work their election workers crazy trying to follow nonsensical orders. Also they know THEY are the ones getting blamed/fired when election day is a total shitshow with not enough ballots verified because it was nearly impossible to verify them but they have to anyways... especially election workers in democratic precincts who are going to get laid off from budget cuts anyways.
