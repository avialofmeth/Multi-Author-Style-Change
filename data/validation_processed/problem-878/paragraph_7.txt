Do you expect Nato to go first-strike then? No? That leaves Russia. Will they use nukes first, fully knowing that it is a self-destruct button? No. Despite the apparent idiocy of this whole affair, Russia has not displayed characteristics of an irrational actor. They just overplayed their hand. They aren't going to burn their own house down just to spite the west.
