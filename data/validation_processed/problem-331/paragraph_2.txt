So I guess I'd be curious to hear from Brits how much cultural continuity they would like to keep. Could the royals and all of the nobility be removed and lowered to the same as the rest of the citizenry? Should the class of nobles and royals become even more symbolic by, for example, electing a representative and simply calling them King or Queen and pretending? Or should a singular family, by mere quirk of parentage, be propped up as a national symbol to be argued over in perpetuity?
