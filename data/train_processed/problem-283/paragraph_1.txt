That's a scary thought, but it helps to remember this is the message Russia wants to convey. It's clearly in their best interests to stir up public protest in the U.S. to end the war. That doesn't mean the threat is any less scary, but it's important to keep in mind who is the country escalating tensions this entire time. If Russia decides things are too scary for them, they can be the ones to back out of the fight they started at \any\ time.
