Who was that wrestler who, way back in the 1970's, hammered a nail Into his head? My dad took me to see him live - what an experience (I'm female) Then he took me (when I was around 6 years old) to see the LA Thunderbirds Roller Derby; after the show the ladies were standing against the rail, and still had their skates etc on. My dad brought me over to them, and they held me and passed me back and forth from one player to another, going around the rink maybe 10 times I remember liking that -a lot- like, a real lot; which was a very early sign I was a lesbian.
