The Libertarian party has largely supported same sex marriage or at least repealing any laws defining marriage. In the view of a true libertarian a marriage is a contract between two or more parties that is a consensual arrangement. Aside from ensuring there is no coercion and ensuring the both sides uphold the terms of the contract government should not intervene. So a true libertarian would not support outlawing polyamorous marriages, same sex marriages or any other types of non traditional marriage. Anyone holding any other belief on this is not really a libertarian.
