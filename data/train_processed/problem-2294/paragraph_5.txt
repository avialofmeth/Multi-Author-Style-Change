Russia has been led by nothing but corrupt oligarchs in some for or fashion in a basically unbroken line since Ivan the Terrible. This isn't some unique period of bad Russian governance; this is just another iteration of the Russian norm. It's not due to some existential curse, but rather is the result of a people who not only tolerate such corruption and malfeasance but often warmly embrace it.
