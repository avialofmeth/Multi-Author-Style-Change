That said, I wonder if this was something similar: guy sleep walked going to the bathroom but missed the lavatory. I did some googling and they described him as "inebriated," but this smacks of bad drug/alcohol interaction to me. What's most infuriating is how poorly the poor passenger he peed on was treated by the airline. They had open seats in first class but kept trying to get her to go back to her business class seat that still reeked of piss. Whether it was their fault or not, that was a horrible situation that demanded some extra care and service from the airline and the crew.
