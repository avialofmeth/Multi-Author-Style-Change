I honestly don't understand what the problem with the NFTs is. They're just one of many incredibly stupid things this guy pulled, it doesn't stand out at all. In fact it fits right in. And I have no doubt that this will have no consequences to his popularity with his core supporters. Nothing he ever does has any consequences. He's one of the most disgusting humans in this planet, yet he poops in a golden toilet. Criminal referral - so what? He's gonna delay and then get away with it. So, no legal consequences for breaking the law either.
