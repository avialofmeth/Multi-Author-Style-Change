I believe the 10 included Harrisburg and upper York under Perry’s tenure, not exactly sure with the new districting. But I live in Lancaster and only ever hear the region referred to as south central PA, don’t really ever hear people refer to it as south east PA, and the 10th was/is more north west than Lancaster.
