We have a machine hooked up to the bag that routinely pump stuff into the bag to maintain the atmosphere inside. If the hole is small enough to not cause a significant pressure drop, no alerts are triggered but oxygen could still leak in and wreck random havoc. Once, we were alerted of a bag with low pressure failure and we found a dog had somehow made a meter-wide gash in the bag. She had given birth to puppies under the vehicle.
