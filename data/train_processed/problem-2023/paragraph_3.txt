No friend we voted with our wallets and bought cheap Chinese goods. We didnâ€™t have to do that and we could of supported unions, workers and Made in America instead. The globalization push was from inside the beltway and our elected leaders. Sure they are bought and paid for by corporations but we are complicit in letting it happen. We gotta stop blaming others for the things we collectively support. Time to fight back and change it.
