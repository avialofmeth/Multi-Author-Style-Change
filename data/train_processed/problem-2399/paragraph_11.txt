u/Psychonauticalia If we’re being honest here, most of the world’s miseries are not due to oppression from traditional religion. A substantial portion, yes, let’s spitball up to 20%, but ‘most’ is online exaggeration and throwing a news article of something horrible in Australia doesn’t change that. Most child rape, murder, etc. are done at a personal level, if we are honest, and there is plenty of misery conducted on a political level outside that: consider China’s 1.4 billion people. People have been executed for petty crimes and treason far more than heresy, and this last century saw mass murderous regimes based on non-religious ideology as well. You mention ISIS but their entire existence and ‘governance’ is inseparable from war.
