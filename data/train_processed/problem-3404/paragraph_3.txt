Finland has been preparing for Russian invasion for 80+ years, even the infrastructure has been designed with that in mind and terrain is unforgiving. So if Russia tried to invade they would have miserable time. While I agree that joining Nato is very desirable and provides a lot of security, the extortion attempts by Erdogan are not OK. Human rights are not a thing to trade with and even these type of concessions on arms sales send a signal that the behaviour is OK. Russia is fully committed in Ukraine so they have no means whatsoever to attack elsewhere, so I would much rather wait as long as it takes than appease Erdogan. Putin was appeased in 2014 by inaction and look where it led.
