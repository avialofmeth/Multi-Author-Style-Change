Yeah but good luck actually kicking Russia off the Security Council. Unless another country has a better claim at being the legal successor to the Soviet Union replacing Russia would be insanely difficult. Otherwise the UN would need to make a major change to it's structure which isn't going to happen anytime soon, unfortunately.
