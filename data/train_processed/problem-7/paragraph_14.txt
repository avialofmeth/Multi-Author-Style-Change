And note that while Indonesia is vastly and predominantly Muslim, there are areas that are almost entirely Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian within Indonesia that are tolerated and respected by the majority of said Muslims. Indonesians in general are very proud of their tolerance and multi-culturalism. You can find massive Christian cathedrals in Jakarta alongside Buddhist temples. Ensuring that these minorities are free to practice their religion is core to the Indonesian psyche. Alcohol is easy to come by, and you can even eat pork in many places. The entire society is based on mutual respect (i.e. don't shove pork in Muslims' faces and they won't try to stop you from eating it).
