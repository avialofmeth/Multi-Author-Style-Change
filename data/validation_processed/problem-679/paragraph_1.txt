I happily would, but it’s a bit presumptuous isn’t it? I donate money to small local charities but I am not sure I can really walk up to her an offer her £50 for a supermarket shop. Maybe she’s too proud to go to the food bank where she could get more food, I don’t know. It’s not my job to insert myself into other people’s lives. But I also know that we pay good money so that every kid is fed well at nursery - including this little girl who clearly isn’t getting enough food at home, but is at nursery and looks very healthy. Unfortunately there are plenty of kids who don’t have a great nursery to fall back on and don’t get the nutrition they need.
