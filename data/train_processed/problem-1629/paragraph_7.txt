Since the failed Russian attempt at a “thunder run” to Kiev, helped by an influx of relatively small but critical weapons, we have seen the west open the larders up more and more - and Russian tolerance of that fact too. Russian forces are now facing a ukranian army that is pissed, motivated and increasingly equipped with next level equipment. There remains a lot of legacy equipment, but more and more we are seeing that the M777, CAESAR, Pzh 2000, various armored vehicles in the field and each individual system outclasses masses of Russian equipment.
