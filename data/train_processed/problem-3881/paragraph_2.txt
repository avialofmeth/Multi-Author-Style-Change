Putin himself mused, "What good is the world without Russia in it?" "We'll all go to heaven", yawp Putin's toadies on national TV. They have repeatedly tried to normalize the idea that National Suicide / unleashing Armageddon is preferable to defeat. I'm still on the fence as to whether this is for domestic or international consumption. It seems to me that the Putin regime has chosen the North Korean approach of negotiation by provocation, with bellicose actions to underline the rhetoric. The problem for Putin is that no one takes North Korea's outlandish, apocalyptic threats seriously anymore.
