Unfortunately sometimes the path to true peace is to fight. If Ukraine negotiates with Russia, and the resulting agreement ends with Russia holding any more land than when they started this war the lesson will be that military conquest is still a viable strategy, and it will only be a matter of time before Putin decides to take another bite, or someone else decides to attack their neighbour, because, hey it worked for Russia. And if a peace is agreed to, the sanctions will probably be lifted, and the lesson taken from that will be that if you can tough out the sanctions and force your opponent to the negotiation table the sanctions will disappear, which will only encourage escalation.
