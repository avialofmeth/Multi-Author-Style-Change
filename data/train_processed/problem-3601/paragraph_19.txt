So the point is, the blame is mostly on Israel. Since Israel took the lands of West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in their illegal war in 1967, they've brutally occupied those territories. Stealing, killing, forcefully removing non-Jews, destroying entire communities... yeah, that's why a lot of Palestinians will keep fighting. To protect their homes.
