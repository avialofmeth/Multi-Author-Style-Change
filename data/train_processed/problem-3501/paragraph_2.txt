Imagine this, you're Putin. You invade Ukraine in 2014 and take a major region without a fight. Then you invade another region and kinda start winning until they fight back. After you inject some amount of your own cadre military Ukraine agrees to negotiations. After this you get reports on how many NATO instructors and mercenaries your army and proxies are killing in Ukraine. You also receive all the reports about successful PSYOPs and protest actions which were launched because of Russian involvement.
