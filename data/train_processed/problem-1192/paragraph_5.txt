I don't think it was stupid, so much as alliances, they had too many anti-GOP folks in their ranks. The next GOP president has a roadmap to securing forever power, and that could have been a plan before Trump got the nomination, they just put a pin in it for 4 more years because of how many conservative enemies Trump's allies like Bannon had.
