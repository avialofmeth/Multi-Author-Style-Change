Like, the obvious interpretation of the two things you posted together suggests to me that a Bangladeshi woman who has a child not registered with any other citizenship would pass her Bangladeshi citizenship onto the child regardless of where the child is born, while one who has one who does get registered for any other citizenship would not have Bangladeshi citizenship, since they need to specifically apply for dual citizenship.
