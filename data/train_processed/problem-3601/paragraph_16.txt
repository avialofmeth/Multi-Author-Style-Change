Israel exists officially as a country & is recognized by the UN because it was created by the UN. The UN recognizes the US because the US founded the UN as a means to prevent another World War, but yes, most, not all, the land was stolen from the Native American tribes. Also, while yes what became the land of Israel already had Jews living in the regions before it's official formation, they were a minority in the population prior to the formation of Israel, when the Israeli's basically either forcefully removed, killed or relocated Arab Palestinians during and after the 1947 Palestinian Civil War.
