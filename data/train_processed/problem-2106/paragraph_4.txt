The GOPe lost the narrative blame game on twitter over the weekend when the GOPe's deliberate funding fails/sabotages were hung out like dirty laundry for the world to see. DeSantis has kept his mouth shut and we have already seen Tom Cotton read the tea leaves to announce he ain't touching the 2024 cycle unless Trump bows out. The neocons have invested heavily in Tom's infiltration from neocons hero to maga acolyte which suggests the DeSantis push might have been less than a neocon leadership unified advancement.
