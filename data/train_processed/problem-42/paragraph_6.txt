Another easy, low cost, low technical way to insulate your windows without replacing is by removing the frame around the window (wood detailing that is really just hiding where the drywall ends and your actual window frame begins) exposing the wooden frame everything is mounted on, and spraying (window and door specific!) insulation foam in the gaps to eliminate draft as much as possible.
