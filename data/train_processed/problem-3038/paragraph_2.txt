These guys are so afraid that they had to put "Nordic" there to put credibility on them because "loser Islamic faction who had to escape to Sweden from Turkey because of another Islamic faction in Turkey" sounds a bit less credible. They draw their news from their times in Turkey, and it's very apparent in their titles. They were in Turkey when Turkey had the idea of "Muslim Brotherhood". When it turned out Muslims had no business or interest in being a brotherhood, Turkey turned to Israel and other allies. Turkey doesn't care about Kashmir or Palestine anymore. SADAT is now at their lowest.
