I've never been more proud to have my "I voted" sticker. Well...aside from that time I helped vote out Trump, that was cool too. Oh and that time I taught some guy's kid to ride a bike in 30 minutes after he spent weeks trying and I saw him yelling at his kid so I helped. But that's it. 3rd proudest I've been in a while.
