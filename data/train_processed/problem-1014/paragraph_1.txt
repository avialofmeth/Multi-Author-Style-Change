If not fighting for the North you mean fighting for the South then yes. You understand what a war-time economy means? Basically everyone was involved in things that directly contributed towards the war. If you lived in the South and grew cotton that you sold to the Confederacy you were complicit. That's a simple ass concept so I don't know why we need to hash that out? Not to mention the war didn't start to eradicate slavery but it was started to stop the spread. Plenty of Northerners were slave holders. Pro Union doesn't equal anti-slavery.
