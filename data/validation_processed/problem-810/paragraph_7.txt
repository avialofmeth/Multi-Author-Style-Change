Ukraine is not an anything member of NATO and the fact that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine are still alive makes that obvious. Your application for NATO was rejected years ago, we are being nice and helping but don’t confuse this for something that it’s not. Not being a dick but we’re not friends with Ukraine we just really don’t like Russia.
