I'm not sure it's literally "most" but it's an embarrassingly high amount. And they are typically people obsessed with power and control, which makes sense because a core tenet of fascism is the idea that "only I can solve this problem." If they're wrong about it, then they're not only not the only one who can solve it, but they're not even one of the many people who can solve it. It takes a big ego to be a successful fascist.
