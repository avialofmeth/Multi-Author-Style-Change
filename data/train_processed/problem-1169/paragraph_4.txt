I’m not sure this means they can’t win the next Presidential election depending on the candidates? It may provoke some in fighting with being a trump loving election denier having been more successful , in general, in nomination than election? And the possibility of a Trump and DeSantis grudge match? I guess a lot depends on the economy , whether Biden runs again as age takes it’s toll and if not whether the Democrats can find a convincing replacement?
