This was actually a big issue with trans rights in western countries in the past and still a bit to this day. Even many "trans-friendly" doctors would deny people transition if they didn't have "gender-appropriate" sexual attraction. Which (in part) led to a long and storied practice of trans people lying through their teeth and saying whatever the doctors wanted to hear in order to get care.
