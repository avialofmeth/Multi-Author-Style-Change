I don't know why you're getting downvoted but yeah there are definitely problems with nurses in the US. My mom is a nurse and was working 12 hour shifts sometimes 5-6 days a week during peak covid because of staffing issues. Nurses rarely go on total strike because when you're in a field like medicine, that can have immediate and tangible negative consequences for your patients, and nurses generally don't enjoy putting their patients' health at risk.
