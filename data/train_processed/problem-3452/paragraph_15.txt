Ben-Gvir did not magically acquire his seats out of thin air. The exact same political instability that befell Lieberman and moved him to the center-left camp, and then Bennett, will befall him. I do not see that happening--him picking a fight with the Ultra-Orthodox or upholding the state's values--hence I expect the camp to fracture as I do not see Ben-Gvir as a compromising man or a politicking one.
