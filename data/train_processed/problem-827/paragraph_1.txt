Yesterday I got into an argument in an "anti-war" sub (ie: pro-war, and even pro-genocide, as long as it isn't done by the West) with a guy who claimed that Ukraine was slaughtering people in Donbass (even if only around 300 civilians from both sides had died since 2016, after the end of the high intensity conflict, up to the February invasion, with the number of fatalities getting smaller with each year) and that the Army was filled with Nazis (even if Ukraine itself is, depending on the study, way less anti-semitic than Russia or downright the least anti-semitic country in Eastern Europe, and that the far-right parties only have one single seat in the Parliament).
