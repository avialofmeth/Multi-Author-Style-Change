This makes way more sense than making it illegal. Combine them with vape and liquor stores. Shops don't do too well when they are too limited on what they are allowed to sell. Expect black market to pick up though. It's going to suck not being able to pick up a pack at the gas station... wait shit. What happens when everyone is driving an EV?
