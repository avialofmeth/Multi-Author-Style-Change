Were there other specific individuals (judges or non-judges) from that seven person short list Governor Hochul was provided as qualified candidates that you would support or do you have other individuals in mind? I'm just curious. I've been following this somewhat closely (I live in New York too) but now I'm curious what Governor Hochul will do next - push for a full Senate vote regardless (she and her team believe that is an option according to an article I read today) or LaSalle withdraws. Guess we will see.
