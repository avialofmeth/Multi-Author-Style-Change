Commanders are responsible too. We’ll imagine we goto war with Russia and we tons of soldiers fall ill to RSV, Flu and Covid. What’s worse is we get disability pay from the VA. Getting ill will increase the chances of things going wrong for you older. Most in the mil got the shot and don’t mind. It’s loud minority and proudboy like types causing the issue. Again, not an issue before Covid. Seriously, republicans may as well create a new religion called “My Christianity”.
