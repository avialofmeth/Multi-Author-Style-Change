Wanna have some fun plumbing the depths of US indifference? Poll Americans on which side Portugal and Spain were in WW2. Thanks to movies like The Sound of Music and Schindler's List, a fair % (maybe 25%) of Americans may still know that Sweden and Switzerland were neutral in WW2. With no movies about Portugal or Spain/Salazar or Franco, no such awareness among Americans.
