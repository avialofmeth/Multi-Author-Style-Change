This news company al Jazeera is also a qatar owned company and is know to push propaganda world wide they have been caught pushing different narratives on the same news in different languages, you can search "Nas daily Al Jazeera" on YouTube for more info on this . And at last there is a whisper in the intelligence community world wide that qatar does not have their own foreign agents as they pay terrorists to do their dirty work which cannot be tracked to them.
