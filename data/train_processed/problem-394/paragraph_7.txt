No one is pissed about the election results. The people that fund these things are playing chess in their own time frame. They understand cycles and while trump thinks he's a king, he's really a pawn. They may have planned to do one thing, and trump showing up unexpectedly may have required them to change their goals. But these people do not loose, it just changes what they win and when. Politics is just a cost of doing business to them. They do not cry when they pay the electric bill, and they probably do not even look at the election results after they cut the check.
