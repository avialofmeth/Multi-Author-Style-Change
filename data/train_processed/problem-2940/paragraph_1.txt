Yeah. Duh. If this was a conventional-only type of conflict, NATO could wipe out every Russian position within 100 km of Ukraine within 24 hours. Russia can flex all they want with the nuclear threats. They’re empty threats. If they use one nuclear weapon, no matter how small, it’s the end of the Russian regime as we know it. If they go balls to the wall, first-strike, all out nuclear attack, they have no conventional forces to go and seize or capitulate their targets. Their goose is cooked and it’s only a matter of time. Right now we’re waiting on them to spend themselves so broke that their population starves and revolts, or Putin dies, or both.
