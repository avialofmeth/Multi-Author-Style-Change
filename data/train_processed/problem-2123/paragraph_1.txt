Mr. Intrater is the cousin of Russian Oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. He is one of the Executives that runs a company named Colombus Nova. That company is noted for giving Michael Cohen a half million dollars for "consulting services" in the timeframe between when Trump was elected and before he was Inaugurated. (Side note: Cohen got the cash infusion put into the same account that he used to pay off Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal).
