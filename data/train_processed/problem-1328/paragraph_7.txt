When the election comes, checking R down the ballot makes them feel as if they are doing their part and their peers confirm their biases, because neither think critically about the situation, they just do what they are told will make their lives better, not ever noticing that their lives don't change much, if at all, and when it does, it's actually for the worse. Look at Texas and their energy grid or the price of insulin (which has been mostly fixed by Dems now), or social security.
