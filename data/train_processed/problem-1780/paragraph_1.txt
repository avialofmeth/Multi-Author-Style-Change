Ok human rights violations get my goat as much as the next technology deserving empathetic valuable human being , but also is it not fucking annoying that you're always hearing record-breaking this and that in relation to stuff that's going ti make you angry?Like why is it record breaking?it just can't be, it's not the climate of the last 10 years.seems to be to generate a reaction more than the truth.
