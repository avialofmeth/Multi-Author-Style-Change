I wish I could send you the screenshot, but of the many many companies involved with child migrant labor use is Ben and Jerry’s and their spokesperson said the MOST fucked thing ever. In a nutshell, they said they work to make sure that working conditions follow the minimum standards and if underage child migrants need to work, then it’s better they work at a place with good working conditions. The dairy industry, according to this article, is amongst the highest in reporting injuries to workers of all industries. Just incredibly tone deaf and looks like I’ll really have to do my homework to find a substitute for ice cream.
