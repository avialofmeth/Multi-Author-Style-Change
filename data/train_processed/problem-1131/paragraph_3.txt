Yup, we had a short window to course correct ourselves and society before we exported our lifestyle to the rest of the world but instead we spread it like a cancer. If we had solved a lot of these issues like rampant consumerism and obsolescence we'd be in much better place. Instead we build products to break. Each product takes energy to create, from trucks to ship them, from factories keeping lights on plus the cost to bury it a year later because they designed it so the battery can't replaced even though every other part on the product works perfectly.
