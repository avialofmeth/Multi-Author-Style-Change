... you do realize that Israel still occupies the Gaza Strip right? They control the air, sea and land all around Gaza. Gaza for decades had to get everything through Israel, while Egypt rarely opened up their border to Palestinians. Food, water, power, products, everything has to come through Israel. So no, they still occupy the Gaza Strip. Oh, and Israel is directly responsible for the creation of Hamas.
