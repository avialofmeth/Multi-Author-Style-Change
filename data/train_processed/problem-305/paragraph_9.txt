One of the biggest threats to the Netherlands right now, and our security services agree, are far-right extremists who may commit terrorist attacks. We also call them "tokkies" which is similar to the English word "chav". They're very dumb people who tend to live off unemployment benefits and spend their time on Facebook finding some way to make every topic about Mark Rutte or Sigrid Kaag. Then they go back to their Telegram groups with other neo-Nazis for instructions. It's very sad.
