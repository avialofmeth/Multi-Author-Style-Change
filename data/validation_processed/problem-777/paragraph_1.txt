I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. Things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. This, entering the mosque, and palestinian flag incidents are just a start.
