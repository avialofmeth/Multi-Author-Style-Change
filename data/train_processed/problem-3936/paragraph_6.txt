And this is also a good thing. Remember that the recommendations are symbolic and for the purpose of recorded history. The commitee has given the DOJ tons to look at, but the DOJ needs to be the ones to decide based on legal criteria (and hopefully they will get successful convictions in the future). I would never want a Congress with the power to indicite (just imagine the abuse of that power if the GOP could use it).
