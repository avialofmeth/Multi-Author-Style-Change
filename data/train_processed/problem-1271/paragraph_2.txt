This is a terrible proposal. This creates perverse incentives that can cause harm to inmates who feel that there is no way out other than to donate organs. We shouldn't create incentives like this that make people have to weigh donating organs vs being treated with dignity. This is completely unethical. I'm more in favor of community service, rehabilitation/therapy courses, or heck even working in a high demand sector in exchange for reduced sentence such as paramedic, fire fighter, rural doctor, educator in low income areas ect. I think giving people options to become productive members of the community is a far better way reducing the number of people incarcerated than organ donation.
