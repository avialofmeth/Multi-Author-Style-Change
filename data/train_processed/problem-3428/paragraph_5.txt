There has been one house that was burn down and there have been many moments where airports in Peru have been taken. These are illegal actions that shouldn't occur. That still doesn't mean that the mass protests going on today is just "a riot". In the last few weeks there have been riots, there have been strikes, there have been vigils, there's a lot going on nonstop all over the country involving many different people and the one thing they can all agree on is that they want Dina to leave.
