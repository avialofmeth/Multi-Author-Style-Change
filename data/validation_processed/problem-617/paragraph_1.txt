Everyone complaining even though Bill Gates's humanitarian work has saved more than 50 million people. These are some of the world's poorest suffering form diseases the developed world had eradicated almost a century ago. You guys can complain all you want about how "mean" Microsoft was as a company in the 90s, if there is a utilitarian heaven, Bill is going there.
