He got tired of being fired from every 24 hour news channel for being an exceedingly bland neocon whose entire personality consisted of a bow tie, and knew FOX was his last chance. So, he gives his audience what he thinks they want, and he makes great money doing so, but he's still an exceedingly bland neocon.
