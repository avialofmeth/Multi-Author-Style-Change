EDIT: Am I understanding correctly that if he had waited until he had been sworn in, then the Dems would have been able to run a candidate? So no different than McCain playing the rules by holding on until his death rather than retiring earlier, thus making it that the Arizona governor got to appoint his replacement rather than a special election being run to handle it.
