Ah, this shit again. I'm a 53 year old Swiss man and I have never seen or heard of people eating cats or dogs, beyond tales of poor mountain farmers resorting to eating things like pets, shoe leather and so on when trapped in the high alps or facing starvation from crop failures. Think Donner party type scenarios.
