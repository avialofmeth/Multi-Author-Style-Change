Wow, that's a really shit article that cherry picks elements to cast doubt on American media and military. Legal Eagle just did an about this, and point out that China's claims are all ridiculous bullshit, like claiming it was a weather balloon, which would be legal, if under certain size and weight restrictions; spoiler, it's dozens of times larger and heavier than what the international law allows, or would feasibly be a weather balloon. Just because the US isn't publicly detailing every element of info they may or may not have does not make them hawkish on this incident. I just lost a lot of respect for this news source.
