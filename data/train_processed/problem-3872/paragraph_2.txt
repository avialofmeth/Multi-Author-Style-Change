This is great way of looking at it. I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talk about our insignificance in comparison to the vastness of the universe. Yes, we are physically small in comparison to stars and galaxies, but we are also literally the universe observing itself. That’s pretty damn significant, in my opinion, and it’s unique in comparison to the vast majority of “stuff” in existence. Without sentient creatures like us (and any others that might exist), the universe would not even know about itself.
