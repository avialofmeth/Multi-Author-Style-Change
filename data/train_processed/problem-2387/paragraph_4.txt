In non-healthy trials i.e. those where the volunteer needs to have a certain condition, they're looking for a cure. I helped run an ance study where participants required a certain grade of acne (on the Leeds acne scale. Bristol got stool, Glasgow got coma, Liverpool had palleative care pathways. Leeds is known for acne.) The treatment was so successful for one candidate they really didn't want to return the device.
