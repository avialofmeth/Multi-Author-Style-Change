I can't find any article saying they stopped paying, hence me asking. I know the RNC said they "can't" and "won't" pay Trump's legal bills if he announced, which he has since done. However, I've seen no confirmation that they actually stopped paying them. I'd be interested in knowing whether they did stop, and seeing what kind of revenge Trump puts them through in response.
