Let me get this straight. A WNBA player goes to Russia with HashOil in a vape pen. An illegal substance. Gets convicted for violating the law and then some assclown in the state department says yeah trading a man who puts our citizens, aircraft, and military at risk is a great trade to get her out of prison. Who negotiated this? This is the problem with our country, we are more worried about the way this looks, then safety and security for all. What a bunch of crap. How many people will now die because of this exchange?
