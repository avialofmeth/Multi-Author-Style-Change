Like his "twittergate" bullshit about Hunter Biden? Describes it as government officials demanding they remove information about Hunter...The reality, it's Biden's campaign (not the govt) requesting they remove unauthorized pictures of Hunter's dick. Does Elonae actually think that's a 'smoking gun' for government overreach or does he simply know his rubes won't know the difference?
