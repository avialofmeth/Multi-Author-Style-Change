I'm sorry if that offends you but it's reality. If it were left leaning groups I'd be calling them out. If it's left leaning groups in 50 years I'll call them out. But just look back over the last 4 decades and think about which groups overwhelmingly commit terrorism. Far right lunatics. The manipulation works the same with terrorists as it does with far right authoritarians. It's much easier to radicalize conservative minded people. Just look at history. And it's happening now with conservative minded people.
