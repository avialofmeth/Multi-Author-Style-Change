Agree that most people are not ready for a ccw - myself included(also a medical mj patient so I couldn't if I wanted to lol). I don't mind it existing, but I think the process should be more rigorous, it's a big responsibility and a huge danger if you attempt to defend yourself against another person with a gun pulled without really knowing how to. There was actually a study done in Philly by Upenn(can link if you'd like) that found that ccw holders were something like 4x more likely to get shot in cities and when they did it was often more severe than non ccw-holders.
