A lot of it might happen where there isn't enough gov order and resources to manage the situation properly like in south asia (india etc). These places must acknowledge that its an inevitable future and must build culture around it so people can handle that situation. These countries also need to make deals with other countries so they can move these people away to higher ground. Country's borders wouldn't matter when hundreds of millions of people start moving. It'll be chaos. Better option is to prepare to handle it properly.
