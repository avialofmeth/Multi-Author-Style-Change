Nuclear weapons are pretty much always stored inside a protected facility to safeguard them from first-strikes. A nuclear weapon has a strong tamper and reflector blanket around the fissile core to contain the initial nuclear reaction while it's critical for enough time to allow the reaction to continue and increase the yield. The conventional expolsives in a nuclear device are very insensitive to prevent accidents from occurring. Additionally the fissile materials within the warhead are dense, solid material - not radioactive glitter.
