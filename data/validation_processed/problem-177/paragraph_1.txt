There's no better tonic to be found for making me joyous than watching Kevin McCarthy twist in the wind and be utterly humiliated by his own party. The man is truly vile and does not deserve anything. That the Democrats have actually banded together in solidarity and refuse to help end this GQP made mess is quite remarkable, given the past history of that party being weak at moments when it should've shown strenh. I already predict that this fiasco will be the foundation for the Democrats regaining the House in two years time.
