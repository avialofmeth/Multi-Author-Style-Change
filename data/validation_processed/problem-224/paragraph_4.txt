It depends on whether the werewolf in question has embraced their curse or not. If they've embraced it, they'll turn out because they understand that the evil and chaos caused by Walker's election will far outdo any chaos they can do themselves. If they've resisted their curse, they will be out causing the classic werewolf chaos.
