It’s a little weird for me, a girl who is female, but hey - if it makes someone feel better about who they are, I’m all for it. I have absolutely no problems calling a person what they want to be called. It’s a lot like arguing that a person named ‘William’ shouldn’t be called ‘Bill’ - that person feels more comfortable as a Bill and associates with the name Bill, so yes, we call them Bill.
