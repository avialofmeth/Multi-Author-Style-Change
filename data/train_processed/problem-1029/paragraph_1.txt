The only proposal that has a vague chance of being accepted would be return to pre-war borders, recognition of Crimea as Russian, and some kind of non-NATO security guarantee for Ukraine, plus substantial reparations from Russia. Gets Russia out of Ukraine and leaves Ukraine no worse off geopolitically since getting Crimea back or joining NATO were unrealistic goals for Ukraine anyway. Allows Putin to present it as a 'win' since they 'stopped' NATO expansion and won Crimea and he can frame reparations as being generous Russian aid. Will help reduce Russian nationalist paranoia about NATO Russia's power declone and will limit the possibility of future Russian aggression since China will have a strong incentive to pressure Russia to stick to their peace plan. Hopefully it will last until the Russian cold war nationalist generation dies out in politics.
