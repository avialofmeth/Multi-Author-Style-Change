They lost that county based on one thing, the Latin vote who believed the crap and nonsense that the GOP was spreading that Socialism is the same as Communism which is what ruled the countries they left. What the Dems need to do is change tbe narrative, that the countries they left weren't socialist, they were ruled by dictators/authoritarians who said they would fix everything and then took everything. Show how those people are the same as the DeSantis's, the Trumps and all the people that are using them to try and take more and more of their freedoms they act like they are defending.
