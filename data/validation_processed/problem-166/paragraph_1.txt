The heart and soul of the school is (or was, maybe) the philosophy of not letting the institution get in the way of education - undergraduate only, narrative evaluation of every student's individual performance, a month every year dedicated to just independent research/art projects and a thesis your senior year. And the administration was incredibly accommodating - if you could prove an interest of even just half a dozen people, students could ask the faculty to cover tutorials or even hire guest professors to teach subjects not normally offered. And that's to say nothing of the culture of the students, which is incredibly diverse and open to new ideas.
