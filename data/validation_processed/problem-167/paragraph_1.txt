The GOP majority was created with less than a total of 7,000 votes in the seats they flipped. They had record inflation to run on and an incumbent President with an approval rating barely at 40%. Even with all that, they STILL needed a GOP partisan gerrymand in Fl upheld in the courts and a Dem partisan gerrymand in NY thrown out by the courts to get their majority. If that is the best they can do, they are screwed in â€˜24 when there is a presidential election happening.
