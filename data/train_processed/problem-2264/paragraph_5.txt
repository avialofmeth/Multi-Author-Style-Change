It's not just the UK by any means. Russians talk down everything thats western military. I used to work with a former Soviet era attack helicopter pilot who ended up living as a refugee in Australia. Even 20 years after the end of the cold war, he would automatically talk down anything western, especially of course American. Phhht Abram's tank is rubbish, Russian tank... bla bla.it was kind of amusing. Believing their own propaganda has come back to bite them on the ass.
