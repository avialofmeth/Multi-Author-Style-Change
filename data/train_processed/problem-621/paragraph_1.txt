Russia only wants time to negotiate to stall and rearm and find more bodies. Putin wants Ukraine. His obsession no matter how many die. Ukraine wants all the territory stolen from them. There seems little to no room for compromise. I think Washinon is only sounding like they want Ukraine to be open to talk just to sound better. Putin constantly lies and bullshits. First nazis in Ukraine and now Satanists? Yeah, some sane stuff there.
