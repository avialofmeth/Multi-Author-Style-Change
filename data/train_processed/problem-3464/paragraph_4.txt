BUT STILL Germany sent a lot of military and humanitarian stuff. Why did the outcry because of Switzerlands ammunition delivery denial for the Gepard stop? How hard must a genocide be to adapt your laws to the current situation? There are currently 30 Gepards in Ukraine defending their civilians from the genocial attacks from Russia and dozen more Gepards will follow. Now it's a race between its ammo depletion and the current plans to produce the ammo in Germany and Ukraine. I know Switzerland send a ton of humanitarian help but what could Switzerland fear if they would give up their neutrality? No one would ever invade them and no country would survive a nuclear holocaust...
