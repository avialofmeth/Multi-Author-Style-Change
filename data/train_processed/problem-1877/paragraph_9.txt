Any forest in Canada that is currently being harvested was planted in the late 70's and early 80's at the latest, in a period where the laws didn't define the practices required for a sustainable forestry sector. You can't claim that the forestry sector is unsustainable when the forests we're currently working in were planted over 50 years ago, obviously they were not using the most sustainable practices when planting those forests. All the laws pertaining to sustainable forestry will only come to fruition in 40 years at the earliest.
