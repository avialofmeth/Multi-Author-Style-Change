On 1962, also note that China’s 1962 invasion took India completely by surprise. The CCP (in a move right out of Hitler’s playbook) had signed a peace treaty and mutual non-aggression pact with India in 1954. India’s govt. — being colossally stupid and naive IMO — actually thought China would never attack it, given the countries’ shared professions of Sino-Indian friendship and distaste of colonial rule. Indian soldiers were completely unprepared and basically sitting ducks for the invading Chinese. I doubt India would make that mistake with China again.
