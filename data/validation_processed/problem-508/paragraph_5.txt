To underestimate China is to do so at one’s peril. BRI, in my limited understanding, is absolutely a way to cement control over infrastructure and commerce and primarily benefit China, while also strenhening emerging economies and relationships in Africa and the Middle East. Established economies benefit China less, but having a strong presence in those first-world countries is important for technology “acquisition” and competitive intelligence.
