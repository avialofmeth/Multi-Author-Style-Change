Current events are very unpredictable because history makes us think they are predictable. It's the same phenomenon where 2nd amendment nuts want guns to overthrow a tyrannical government, but if they were actually students of history they'd understand how rare it is that armed revolt leads to positive change. It's not even clear cut that the American war for independence WAS good change when it led to slavery lasting well after nearly all other nations, the genocide of American Indians, conquest of Mexican land, and frequent regime change in Central and South American governments, not to mention the very Iranian regime in question.
