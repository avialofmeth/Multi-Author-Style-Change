Trick is, the way of thought of countries that do not align with the West is MUCH different from what the media portrays. Of 8 billion people, only about 1.2 billion total participate in trying to punish Russia at all costs (and even there, it’s hard to say how many are doing it against their will, even if one puts aside Hungary and eastern Germany). In the eyes of others, seizing these assets will be a far bigger thing than it seems, and will not be justified. It’s unlikely to collapse the entirety of the financial habits overnight, but it will inevitably prompt a lot of investors to diversify, and that’s where Asia will come out. It will be terminally stupid for them not to offer something of opportunity.
