You're overstating the Abraham Accords. While it was a historical breakthrough in normalizing relations between Israel and many Arab countries, it didnt "bring peace to the middle east." The Palestinian question is still unanswered, and the Accords clearly favored Israeli interests there, which is why the Palestinians didnt show up to sign. But it certainly warmed Israeli-Arab relations overall.
