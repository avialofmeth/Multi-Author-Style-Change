If RNC moves their primary to SC first as well, Nancy Mace actually has a really good shot. While we do have a truly embarrassing and terrifying amount of Trump support here, there are enough moderates/primary jumpers who would rather her be the candidate than Trump, for whatever reason. (SC has open primaries you do not have to be registered with a party to vote in their primary, but you can only vote in one party primary per election year. That's for the state at least. I haven't lived here long enough to know how the federal election primary works - there was no R primary in 2020 at the federal level.).
