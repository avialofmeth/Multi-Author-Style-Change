If you refer to several hundred thousand people over hundreds of cities and towns as settlers and settlements respectively, then that's also quite inaccurate. Many of these "settlements" existed before Israel itself, some even for thousands of years. The vast majority of the "settlers" are actually just residents of Jerusalem.
