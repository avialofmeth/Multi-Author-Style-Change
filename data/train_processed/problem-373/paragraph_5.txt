Yeah, never mind the money lost, but it must be so heartbreaking to promise your kids some amazing foreign holiday, probably talk about it for months and drive all the way to the airport, only to learn you fucked up and confused the airports. It's only a third-hand anecdote and my heart goes out to those people, I hope they're happy.
