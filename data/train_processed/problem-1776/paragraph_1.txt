This is something we only wish for Sweden. I think we still have have the highest death count of heroin addicts in the EU. Drug laws here are ridiculous. You could get sentenced to 6 month in prison for having smoked weed. No possession or anything, just being high. It's up to the courts to decide. The police can also force you to produce a urine sample or take a blood sample from you upon suspicion. The clinics you describe most probably do not exist here. You may think Sweden is progressive, and liberal, but when it comes to drug laws we live in the dark ages still.
