Gender is a socially constructed thing we base society on which both sexes are supposed to act/think in a certain way. Literally no part of that is sexual. In fact children have a basic concept of who they are as far as their gender is concerned around 4 years old. Sexuality does come later but I promise you that teaching kids it's okay to not be straight won't end society.
