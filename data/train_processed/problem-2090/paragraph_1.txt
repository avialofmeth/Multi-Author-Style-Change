Shame we had to be the Canary in the coal mine. Glad Brazil also handled their insurrection so decisively instead of doing what we did. At least some are learning from our rightwing catastrophes. Right now our rightwing are trying desperately to incite a race war and civil war and so far we've been a bit lacking in our attempts to quash that unfortunately, so however our politicians botch this just remember "dont do what they did" and you'll already be ahead of the game.
