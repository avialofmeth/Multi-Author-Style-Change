Why? If tobacco companies can make 20 decent marijuana cigarettes, and sell em for 50, 100 bucks even, and don't add bullshit chemicals to them like they do with tobacco, they'd be making billions easily. People are already smoking less cigarettes and I'm confident the tobacco industry is gonna hop right onto making them as soon as federal legalization happens.
