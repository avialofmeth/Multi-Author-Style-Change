When it comes to intention i agree, capability that's another story. America would absolutely demolish the Russian army in a direct confrontation. But the Russian govt isn't focused on right now, sure Europe might not be able to invade but that can theoretically change in the future. You know the old adage, "don't invade russia in the winter". Problem is that leaves the rest of the year where russia's borders are perpetually vulnerable.
