There are a lot of sources but some are behind paywalls. I chose this be because itâ€™s not paywalled but the gist is that if you are an energy investor or a business looking to increase the energy supply it is far cheaper to build a new wind/solar/offshore plant that generates more electricity for less investment and is cheaper on operating costs. These plants are beating coal by a mile now.
