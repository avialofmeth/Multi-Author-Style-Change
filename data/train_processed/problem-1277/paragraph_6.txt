Except people are greedy. For some jobs they do really make sense. Sales is a huge example. One person could feasibly walk across the street to another company and poach every customer putting one out of business. Now if we were in the world of unicorns and rainbows and people played nice that wouldn't happen, but unfortunately people are assholes.
