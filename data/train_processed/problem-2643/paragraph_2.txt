Obviously, I haven't really interacted with Carpathian Ukrainians enough to confidently judge anything - the westernmost region that I've ever lived in is Lviv oblast - but it seems to me that this whole "Hungarians and Romanians in Transcarpathia are being discriminated against" might be a bunch of isolated instances overblown by Hungarian and Romanian governments into some kind of a "big problem".
