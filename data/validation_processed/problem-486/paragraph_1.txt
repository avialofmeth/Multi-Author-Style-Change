And if North Korea sends troops to Ukraine, South Korea must seriously consider doing so as well, or at least a very large number of non--combatant Abrams and F-16 maintenance technicians, fully equipped.

The Pacific Rim nations must respond to what China and India (after their abstention votes in the UN) are or are not, doing in Ukraine. As the worlds most populous neighbors, they both have the most to gain from the "support the non-aggressor" precedents increasingly being reinforced in Ukraine.
