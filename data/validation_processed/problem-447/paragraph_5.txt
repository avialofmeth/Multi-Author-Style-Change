Afaik, Chang suggested that Paludan burned a Turkish flag, not a quran. The quran was Paludan's idea, and that's what he's been doing for years. At least from all I've heard from him when he was active here in Denmark, I'm pretty sure he would've done what he did at some point either way. At most, Chang nudged him to protest it at the right place and time.
