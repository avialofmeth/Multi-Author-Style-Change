Today some missile strikes did happen, so it was a bit less quiet than usual. At around 11:35pm we heard some explosions, about a minute later an air raid alert was triggered and that was when we realized that the explosions were from Russian missiles. We didnâ€™t have any prior warnings, so the missiles were most likely launched from some unusual place, probably somewhere deeper in Belgorod oblast.
