Oh, the Catholic Church will still be deeply involved in politics. They just chose to maintain a little bit more distance between their politics and the Republican party's politics. This priest wasn't an advocate for the political positions of Catholicism; he was just a partisan Republican using his position as a priest to spread the Republican message. The Catholic Church has no interest in promoting conspiracy theories about election fraud, and they don't want to kick out all the Democrats as this person did. He was preaching the wrong political message, so they fired him. But they are still quite involved in politics.
