Well problem is that there are concerns it probably has more asbestos then Brazil reported and what is reported is high. it sat to close to nuclear testing ships under the French and probably has a fallout problem and partially radioactive, has already had a major fire and scrap metal from the ship is currently on the tug that has to drag it. And sitting without maintenance and upkeep for about 4 years has it falling apart and actively taking on water. Repairs are far beyond capable unfortunately. Itâ€™s only value is scrap but the metal itself is possible so harmful that the cost of Protections needed for the workers and decontamination of the metal would probably outweigh the value of the scrap.
