Spain's right-wingers are not the same as in the US. If you've ever spoken to one and asked them about their views of the guardias' abuses against the Catalonians, the Galicians, the Moroccans, or how we used to ban gitanos from entering towns/cities which prevented them from being able to access schools/hospitals until 1976--you will discover that not one of them had any compassion to start with. Assholes like the Vox party () want all of us to go back to living like our parents and none of us want it.
