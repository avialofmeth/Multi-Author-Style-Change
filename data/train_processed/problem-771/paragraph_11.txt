Edit: Also I will admit that there is an inherent difference in that everything in Russia is under more government control than the United States which is more private Enterprise. The difference is negligible though because the result is two private armies that are still essentially a wing of their nations armed forces. It's just that it's a different wing, blackwater (security) and Wagner (assaults and massacres too).
