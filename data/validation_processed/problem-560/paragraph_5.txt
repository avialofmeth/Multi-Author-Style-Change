What's maddening to me is none of Apple's policies are new. I used to have a 4chan app on my phone. Apple pulled it from the app store because of the terrible rhetoric and various kinds of smut on 4chan. Tumblr purged NSFW content in part because they worried it would get them pulled from the App Store. Parler was pulled because it allowed /pol/-style content and Apple simply doesn't want that kind of content in their app store.
