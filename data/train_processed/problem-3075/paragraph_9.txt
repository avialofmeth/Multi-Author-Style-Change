Then big difference is dems are not hung up on party loyalty. Dems will vote for good legislation and will pass help pass things the far right objects to. Once they embarrass themselves the freedom caucus will find they have very little influence. If the party actually splits, the centrist could be much more productive than a similar split on the left. The GOP would not support good legislation from a center faction of dems. The dems needed every dem vote on everything.
