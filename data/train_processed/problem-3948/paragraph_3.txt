It is so wild seeing the pro Kate brown pro Ted wheeler defund the police crowd vote to give cops the authority to approve or deny gun rights for every individual. What could possibly go wrong. A common theme I hear from Portlanders is that the cops are basically white supremacist slave patrols. Yeah let’s let them choose who can and can’t exercise 2A rights. Doesn’t make any sense.
