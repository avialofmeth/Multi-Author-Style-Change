The problem is Russia does not think rationally. It's basically a nation traumatized by multi generational paranoia. This is due to geography. Russia has 100s and 100s of miles of land borders that are effectively impossible to defend. So russian leaders throughout history have had this "offense is the best defence" type of mentality. Which is the primary reason Russia has been such an antagonistic force throughout most of its history.
