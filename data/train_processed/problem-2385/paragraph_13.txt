I despise this current supreme court with a passion, but I suspect in the next 6 months we'll either find out if they're straight up insane, or just playing the manipulative long con game like usual. For similar reasons, I suspect they won't be able to rule too broadly on moore vs harper even if it's Trump and MAGA's dream that they do.
