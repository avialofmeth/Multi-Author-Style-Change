It's also done this way, so people can't try to coerce Ukraine to just giving in. Russia has decided it will throw as many bodies at the war as needed to win, because losing is not an option for a narsacist like Putin. If Ukraine's losses were reported in the same manner, the narrative would shift to them just giving up for the sake of the people. They just don't take in to account that Ukrainian people would rather fight to the last breath, than give in to Putin.
