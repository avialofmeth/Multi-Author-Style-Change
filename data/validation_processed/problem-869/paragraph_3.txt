Someone needs to explain it to Trump this way: At the end of the day, he was an nothing more than a high level employee for the government, not the owner. When you are fired from your job, all documents pertaining to the job and it's trade secrets belong to your boss. He has/had zero authority. He can keep saying he does all he likes, that will never make it true.
