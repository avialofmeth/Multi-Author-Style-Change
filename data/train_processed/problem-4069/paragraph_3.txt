During the Fetterman/Oz campaigns, I constantly saw conservatives saying "how can you support someone that can't even talk!" And all I could think was 'that's the least important part of electing a politician.' I'm not electing someone for how well they speak on the Senate floor, I'm electing someone for how they will vote on the Senate floor.
