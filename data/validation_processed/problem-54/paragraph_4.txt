Welcome to "Nevada is a fucking weird state." New Republican Governor Joe Lombardo spends a good chunk of his State of the State address indulging boilerplate Republican talking points on school choice, election security, and taxes. And then drops this doozy of a budget. Massive spending bumps and public works projects, including a really hefty per pupil spending increase and restoring the higher education system's funding to pre-2020 levels.
