Rather than getting help he doubled down and realised that there was a large enough following of other people having mental health problems who would buy his books/merchandise so why would he get help? He is a finicially a lot richer for not getting treatment, and I think I am right in saying that at least one of his children has followed him into the "family business" but again why wouldn't he? Make claims that can never be proven or disproven and a certain element of society will give you all their money.
