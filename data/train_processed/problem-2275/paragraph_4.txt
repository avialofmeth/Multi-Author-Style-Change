Dude on Halloween came to my door with his grand daughter, and unprompted started blaming Biden for all the restaurants that closed 30 years ago. And ended with some hunter bs. It was the first Halloween out for kids in 2 years and these idiots just want to insert THEIR politics into everything, then get offended when you say you arenâ€™t interested.
