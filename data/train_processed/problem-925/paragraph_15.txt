We have to remember that Marine Le Pen unsuccessfully tried to meet with Donald Trump after his election in 2016. She even traveled to New York in vain before he entered the White House. She had never been invited to CPAC conferences unlike her niece, Marion Maréchal, who was seen as a rising star by some American conservatives. The fact is, Marine Le Pen embodies a very French conception of far-right politics, in which the state keeps a central role. During her last presidential campaign, she blended nationalism with purchasing power concerns, a mix which was labeled as national-consumerism by some French pundits. She also tilted to more progressive positions when it comes to abortion or LGBTQ issues, a clear break with her father (who founded the contemporary French far right in the seventies). The American right’s traditional messages on taxes, religious freedom or guns has no echo in the French far-right.
