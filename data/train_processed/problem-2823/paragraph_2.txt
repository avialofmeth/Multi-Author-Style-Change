Not just a matter of cost although that's a big part of it. It's a matter of scale and pervasiveness. China makes everything. There is not a single US industry that's completely divorced from China. Most buy produced goods and raw materials from china. Those who don't buy their equipment from china. But everyone buys parts and components and the vast majority of electronics are made in china. More than half the world's steel, 85% of all lithium ion batteries are made in china and 95% of all electronics contain at least one Chinese component. It would take trillions of dollars of investment and then years to completely wean the USA off of china and it would be extremely painful for US firms and consumers.
