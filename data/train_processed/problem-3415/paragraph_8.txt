I say: first, you are presenting a false dilemma. There are not only the two options you’ve mentioned. Have you played chess? Why would a player move their knight somewhere that hurts them? Accident. Hubris. Calculation. Just because a move may cause self harm in a way does not mean someone won’t make the move.
