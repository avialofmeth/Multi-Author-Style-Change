Not counting court fees and an attorney and whatnot--ballpark $3K just for staying in jail? That's an estimate of the 30days I spent in work release and miscellaneous dozen or so times I was arrested and only spent one to three nights there. Don't get arrested on a Friday. You won't be in court until Monday for your bail/bond hearing.
