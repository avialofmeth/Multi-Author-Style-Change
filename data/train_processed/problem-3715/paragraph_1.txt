The Media built very heavily on the narrative of Diana the young princess - and as it turns out she was a fantastic woman. Then she and Charles had trouble due to it being an arranged marriage - and the Media built up her side of that story and made bank on the results. When she died due to being pursued by those same Media people - they turned up the blame on Charles. Public opinion has never been on Charles' side and now that he is King, the media continues to ride the unpopularity they generated and the public is swept along with it.
