I have also looked at the speed with which the company is burning to the ground and wondered if it was arson. A trusted massively used social media platform suddenly washed out all the actual celebs and influential people with fake accounts sold for $8 immediately before a sharply contested election. At the same time he goes all in with explicit endorsements of the Republican party just prior to the midterms. While I do not think Musk is the brilliant mind he would fancy himself, I do think no one can be so blindingly stupid as to implode $44B so fast by accident.
