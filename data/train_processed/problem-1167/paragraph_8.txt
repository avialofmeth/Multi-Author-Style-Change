Tropical areas will still be inhabitable, but will be polluted and won't have any nature. Ocean/air acidification, not the least due to AMLO re-allowing sulfurated diesel which will destroy most of the ecology as industrialized urban areas expand. It's central Mexico that will get too hot, and that's where all of Mexico's industry and civilization are. Major new infrastructure is needed for this and it's debatable if the Mexican state can handle the task.
