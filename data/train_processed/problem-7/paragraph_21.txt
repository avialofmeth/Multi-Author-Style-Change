Again, influence does not count as government. In any government, the people without direct power are indirectly or directly trying to influence the decides. This is true in any government and it's true in a democracy. The people with the ultimate power to decide are constantly being influenced by competing forces: corporations, religions, politicians, etc. As long as the people are the ones voting and the votes are free, fair, and uncorrupted, it's still a democracy.
