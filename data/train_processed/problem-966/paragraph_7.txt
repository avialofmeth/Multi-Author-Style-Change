This was a large part of the inflation in real estate prices in the commercial sector, until Covid drove a lot of workers out of their office space and companies started re-thinking their need for centralized offices....... collapsing commercial real estate values and blowing up the scheme in their faces. Now there's a lot of debt that banks can't really collect on because the buildings are all under liens to other entities and lost their inflated value that they loaned out.
