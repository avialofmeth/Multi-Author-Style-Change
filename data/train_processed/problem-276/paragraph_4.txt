Yeah well the article isn't about the Gepard and Marder now is it. In fact nobody knows what exactly it is about and also Spain hasn't even requested permission to send the goods to the Ukraine at this time. According to our government. They won't get the permission regardless (again, according to our government) and that sucks big time (Don't come for me I agree we should let them send the weapons) but they haven't put in a request either. Kinda stinks of virtue signaling and trying to suck up to the other NATO nations. At least put in the request first before you make a statement like that.
