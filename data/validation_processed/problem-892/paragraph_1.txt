I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards. A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff. Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories. It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
