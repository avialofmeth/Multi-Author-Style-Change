Imran was ousted through a democratic and constitutional vote of no confidence, and heâ€™s been stoking violence across the country ever since. PMLN may not be a whole lot better, but Imran is 100% a wannabe fascist (dissolving the NA, jailing more journalists than any previous admin, attacking the judiciary, etc).
