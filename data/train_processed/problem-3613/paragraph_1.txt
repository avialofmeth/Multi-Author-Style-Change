It's honestly a difficult position to be in. When they opposed Roe, that was easy. They could say they opposed Roe because it was judicial overreach, or because the federal legislature should be allowed to make laws about abortion, or because states should be allowed to make laws about abortion, or because Roe should've been the complete opposite and it shouldn't be constitutional have legal abortion at all, or because abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape/incest or because abortion shouldn't be legal after the first trimester or or or or etc. So anyone that thought any of those things could vote for a republican. But now they gotta actually take a real position.
