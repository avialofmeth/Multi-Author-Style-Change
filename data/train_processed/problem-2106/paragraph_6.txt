If McConnell secures Leader then I would expect a lot of behind the scenes pressure for him to leave the Senate early. This is especially true if the Beshear loses the Governor seat in 2023. Rick Scott who has loyalties to no one but his own ego also wants to have Leader next to his name in the history books and maga/trump will happily use him as a chaos whirlwind.
