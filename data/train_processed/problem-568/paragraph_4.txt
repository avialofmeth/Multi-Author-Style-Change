Hypersonic missiles are being flaunted by Russia like Nazis did the V1, except Russia is by no means innovators in this space. Russia also has only used glide hypersonic missiles, and as far as I'm aware, only USA has successfully demonstrated cruise hypersonic missiles, which are significantly more effective (really not even comparable).
