Part of the purpose of the separation of powers is to create different branches of government who compete for and limit one another’s power. But the Florida legislature is showing zero interest in being a meaningful check on DeSantis. It’s not a “jealous” branch, with its own prerogatives; it’s just a rubber stamp for DeSantis’s agenda. And so now we’re seeing it hand this kind of authoritarian power to the governor’s office, again and again.
