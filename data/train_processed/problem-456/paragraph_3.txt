This I remember things really hit the fan about late summer/early autumn 2008, even before the presidential election. The GOP and Greenspan and their anti-regulation stance left a hell of a mess for Obama to clean up. And I remember the Republicans blaming Obama right as he took the helm in 2009 for the whole problem. “Obama is printing money and spending too much” Ggrrrr.
