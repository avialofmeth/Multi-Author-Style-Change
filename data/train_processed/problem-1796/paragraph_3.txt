I had someone suggest to me that the US change their cabinet positions to be Minister of (Whatever). So Pete Buttigieg wouldn't be Secretary of Transportation, he'd be Deputy Minister of Transportation, because the so many in the US are blindly faithful to their churches. They'd be less likely to go against a minister...it was said as kind of a joke, but one with too much truth behind it to really be funny...
