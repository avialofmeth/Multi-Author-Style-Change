Found out the parish priest at my primary school was arrested about a decade after I left, after it turned out he abused a bunch of kids in a child's hospital, and was then moved around the country by the church and it was all covered up, and they placed him as the parish priest of a church on a catholic primary schools grounds of all places... until some kids(turned adults) came out and hunted him down and brought it all back up again.
