Had a friend that I took in who spent time in a homeless shelter, she had met a guy there who befriended her, got her back on drugs, then tried to use sex offered on Whisper for money to get themselves by outside the shelter. She sent me a message with a hidden message in capitalized specific letters. Found her and stopped him, fuck Anaheim's and Los Angeles' useless Police Departments in the whole debacle (learned that day from the operator who told me that if you want the police to come as quick as possible when a crime hasn't happened yet, is to lie to them, imply but don't outright say, hell hang up abruptly to imply something bad happened, keep it short and quick and open ended.) That guy as soon as he was released likely went right back to the shelters to rinse and repeat.
