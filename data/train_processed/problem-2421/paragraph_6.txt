I don't think they will. "More than a dozen wives of mobilized Russian soldiers", so like 12-17 tops. 18 would have been nearly twenty. And even 20 is not a rounding error. The Russians have already lost 100k of their best troops. 300k more are coming. All much less trained and capable. Basically volunteering or drafted to be cannons fodder and immediately die.
