This seems like a good place for a historical reminder that Russian pilots flying advanced Russian fighter jets shot down hundreds of American aircraft during the Korean war and we didn't nuke the Soviet Union. Similar happened in Vietnam, with Russian soldiers manning advanced antiaircraft systems in Vietnam and shooting down Americans.
