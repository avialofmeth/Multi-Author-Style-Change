That means he was caught up in a lie about his claim of religious faith, along with being caught lying that his grandparents were Jews who escaped the Nazis in WW2. So, he's using this defense strategy: I didn't mean I was Jewish, but "Jew-ish", while making air quotes. It's worth hunting down the video of his apology/explanation if you haven't seen it, it's like an SNL skit or something.
