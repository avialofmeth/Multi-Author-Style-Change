Maduro would be dumb to pocket the money. Venezuela’s political strategy has always been this. When oil is scare and expensive they sell high and fund their insane social programs. Everything runs smoothly for a few years because of all the excess capital. But when oil prices drop then the discontent begins. Maduro went through that from 2019-2022 when oil prices were low and managed to stay in power. He’ll spend this money on the country because he has too. The question isn’t whether he’ll spend money on his country during the good times, the question is whether he’ll do it during the bad times.
