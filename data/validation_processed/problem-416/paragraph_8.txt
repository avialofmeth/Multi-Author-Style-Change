According to Indiana Rep. Jim Banks "All of the statistics and polling coming out of the 2020 election show that Donald Trump did better with those voters across the board than any Republican has in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan,"... now Banks could be full of shit, I don't intend to dig into those "statistics" but I do see the non-union "working class" vote being a largely GOP monolith. Since the Tea Party, the GOP voting block of "White - Male - Non College" has grown more than any other.
