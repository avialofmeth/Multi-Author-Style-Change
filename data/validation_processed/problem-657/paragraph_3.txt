worth noting as well, you're going to get an increase in accidents when you have an increase in activity. For example, you don't usually slip and fall when you're calmly going about your business. You slip and fall when you're rushing or are short on sleep. Same goes for equipment failure. If the equipment is just sitting unused, it's not going to break or cause an accident. Once you start mobilizing it, that's when it breaks. You can't drop a crate of explosives if they never move from storage. Only when you start moving/using them can you have an accident with them.
