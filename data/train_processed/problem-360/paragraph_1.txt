But regarding your point in the category of empirical evidence, I would say that people have been noting a tendency towards a grandiose and egocentric sense of self for a while now. Tony Attwood himself noted it in his (2007 being the latest print), date is important to the point and forgot to add it) book "Asperger's syndrome: A guide for parents and professionals" (this was before that syndrome got folded in to broader autism), though not a lot of reason is devoted towards why this occurs, if memory serves correctly (I haven't read the book in a while). I used my own personal experience to chart how the path looked for myself. Now, it is worth mentioning that book had a lot of problems with it, but I think that informs my next point.
