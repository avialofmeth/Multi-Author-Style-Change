Almost like reactionary political actors are more international in outlook than they pretend to be. Hitler and Mussolini backed Franco. The America First Committee of the 1930s and 1940s blew up in a series of scandals when it turned out they were part of a scheme run by German spies to spread Nazi propaganda using the free mail congressmen get by right (and also that they were coordinating with a bunch of weird right wing hate propagandists and paramilitaries). The modus operandi of these types haven't changed.
