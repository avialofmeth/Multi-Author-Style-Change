Edit: there are some oddball exceptions, btw. I know one Jewish doctor who once advocated forced sterilization of the entire African continent and another Jewish dude who is about the most pernicious amplifier and creator of alt-right propaganda imaginable. He gets very upset, for example, when a politician addresses Holocaust denial in society. He never gets upset about the Holocaust denial itself, because it's coming from his own far-right conspiracy tribe. He enthusiatically creates and shares disinformation. Sometimes cryptically incites violence. Both are intelligent, accomplished, older men who I wouldn't label "tokkie", no. Come to think of it, I know a younger Jewish guy who is full-on QAnon.
