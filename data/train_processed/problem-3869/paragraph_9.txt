Even if the weather were to shift in such a manner to maximize water where it needs to be to support the existing systems it will take decades to restore groundwater and replenish the whole region and its needs. Assuming those resevoirs have a nice season every single year and rise a few % it will take 20 to 60 years or more of net gains to restore things, as well as drastically cutting use of that resource.
