It’s broken at every level. The privates and corporals don’t have adequate training, their are no NCOs to lead them and the lowest ranking officers aren’t generally leading the assaults. The mid ranking officers are often 100km behind the lines and don’t really know what is going on on the ground meanwhile competent high ranking officials are considered a risk to Putin so the overall war is being managed by incompetent generals. Meanwhile at every step you have micro management and the pursuit of arbitrary political goals.
