See the problem they fall prone to; is that Republicans have done or could see themselves doing these things ( voting multiple times, rigging elections). Then because they want to do these things they just assume everyone else must want to do these things too. So republicans end up claiming the "other" (side) is doing what they actually want to do. Which is why their latest "The lgbtq+ wants to groom your children" makes me nauseous.
