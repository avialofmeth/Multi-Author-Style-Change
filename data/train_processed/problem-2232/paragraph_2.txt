Don't know what you mean. I loved working at a bazar to earn food money and have an outhouse and no running water...that was a town known as "old Peterhoff" near "New Peterhoff" ....the Russian Versailles where tourists would come and be in awe and I was a feral child in the area. And then school years spent in kommunalka alone. lovely. Great. Great nation. Sigh.
