I mean the best example of this is well…Hitler himself. He wrote mein kampf while he was in prison for you know…the beer hall Putsch(A failed Coup attempt) and it came out in 1925. In that book he laid out his hatred of Jews,leftists,Communists,Bolsheviks and other groups that he hated like the french plus he talked about what he wanted to do.
