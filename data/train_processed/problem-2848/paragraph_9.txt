I do believe they were operating as cheaply as possible, but the NTSB specifically says that the regulation wouldn't have helped. Why would we believe otherwise? Other regulations such as better maintenance or having more people on the train or better detection technology all would have probably prevented the issue. But that one regulation about the brakes. I don't think so.
