I mean to be fair...they have. It's just that the military was in such a terrible state after years of neglect and the endemic corruption. It's almost always cheaper to refurbish rather than produce from scratch and they had so much lying around after the fall of the USSR. They have however "wasted" a significant part of the increased military spending in the Putin era on the Strategic Rocket Forces which is no use to them outside of a full blown nuclear exchange. I suspect there too that a massive chunk has just been lost to corruption. How many of the nominal battle ready tanks for example were actually ready to use vs NATO (where if anything we tend to be rather more pessimistic, reporting tanks as "out of service" due to problems that would be ignored if WW3 broke out). While we do have corruption in the West most of it tends to be on the lines of bribing politicians to buy your weapons systems rather than the weapons systems being paid for but not ending up delivered to the solders (for many reasons).
