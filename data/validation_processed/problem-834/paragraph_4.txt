The problem is the Fed and rest of the government isn’t able or won’t address the problem. When everything goes way up in price for company profits, you can’t realistically cut back enough for the economy to slow down. Starvation isn’t really an option. Being unable to go to work is t really an option. Having clothes isn’t always an option. This results on some amount of the economy continuing to move, even if other stuff slows. And the Fed will just keep trying to make people unemployed because it’s all they know. Congress won’t address the corporate greed. So you end up here. Where the economy looks okay-ish on paper, but is really hanging by a thread. Unregulated capitalism fucking sucks.
