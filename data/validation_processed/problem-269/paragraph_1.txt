The Afficionado Tendieso is a group I like. For the more refined gentlesir who knows the finest minds require the finest refreshments, this guild will help you pair your favorite tendies with the best Dew of choice. But beware: the guild master has an intellect that dwarfs even the most enlightened of gentlesirs. One poor kid tried to argue that Baja Blast was an inferior product and should never have been sold, and the intellectual trouncing he received was so savage the kid never fully recovered. Some say he still aimlessly wanders these lands today, a broken husk of a man with no purpose or destination.
