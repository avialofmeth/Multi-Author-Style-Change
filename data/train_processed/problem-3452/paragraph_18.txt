I'm counting elections-to-elections, which is a proper way of counting, because the limit of 4 years is on Knesset and not on the government. They collapsed because if they didn't, then it would be elections in November anyway. Due to that Liberman created a pretend argument to improve his position for the upcoming elections. Moreover, him leaving the coalition still left the coalition with 61. But again, because it was just a few months before elections would be scheduled otherwise, some other party also decided to make grand-standing on some other issue.
