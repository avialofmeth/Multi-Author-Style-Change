Why are you repeating this? It’s literally not true that the upfront costs for coal are less. It’s just not. At some point years ago that was true but time marches forward. At the moment the cost to start either facility are up but solar/wind/etc are a lot cheaper on both up front costs and operating expenses. It’s not even close.
