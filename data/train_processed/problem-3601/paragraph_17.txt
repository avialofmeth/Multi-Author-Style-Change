The main reason that the Palestinians and most of the Arab states refused to acknowledge Israel, was for three main reasons. First, not a single Arab state, or Palestinian representative was invited, consulted or involved in UN Resolution 181. Second, there was no Palestinian state created alongside an Israeli state. And third, a LOT of Arabs would have to be forced from their homes and relocated, where as very few Jews would've been required to do the same.
