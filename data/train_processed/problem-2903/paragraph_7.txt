I work for a county and yeah pay ain't great that's for sure, but I get by just fine for my lifestyle personally. Luckily our benefits are incredible still though, and there isn't really a chance of those going away. A bunch of holidays, time off, and the health insurance is by far the best plan I've seen out of any of my friends or family. Low stress job is also great. It certainly ain't for everyone, but I'm happy I left the private sector for it.
