It's not a legal change, it is more about the erosion of previously held norms as well as changes in social expectations and increasing win-at-any-cost attitudes pushed by Republicans. Long ago conservative Republicans reported "feeling tricked" that their confirmed SCOTUS justices didn't behave as pure partisan ideologues through their entire life tenure. They felt by being nominated the party was "owed" votes on positions regardless of the legal reasoning. They felt that independence of thought must be prevented. A group called The Federalist Society arose to effectively ensure that any future picks would be held to conservative principles above all else - law be damned. The group is structured as a social-ish club and allows fellow members to gauge the dedication to conservative projects through discussion, debate, and usual social events. This allows the group to determine how strongly they think someone will hold to even the most outlandish political positions. Additionally the social club puts forth suggestions for nominations to Republican presidents who effectively only choose from that list. So if you align with conservatism or the Republicans and want to be nominated as a supreme court justice the only way is to convince the club you will bow to their specific vision of principles without regard to the law. Once justices are seated for life they are free to do what they want but to get nominated they likely had to relationship build enough that if they break with them most of their friendships well be less cordial.
