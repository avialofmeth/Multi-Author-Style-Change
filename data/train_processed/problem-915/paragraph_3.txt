Not it's not... Their Mi-8s weren't used as a heavy lift, they were largely used as simple utility helos for troop lift, airborne, and medivac, so going to UH-60s doesn't present any loss in capabilities. Actually, in terms of airborne and medivac, the CH-47 would be more of a downgrade than the UH-60 would be, due to their size and unique flight characteristics.
