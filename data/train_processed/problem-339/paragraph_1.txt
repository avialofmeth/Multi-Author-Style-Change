An interesting detail not mentioned there is that in the pov video you can see one of the Russians on the ground looking back at his armed comrade, knowing what’s about to happen. In the drone footage of the aftermath you can see that same dude managed to run a few steps before being gunned down. To me that makes it very clear it wasn’t an execution but a return fire that was over in mere seconds.
