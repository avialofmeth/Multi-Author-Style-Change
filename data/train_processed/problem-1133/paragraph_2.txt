There is a cultural affliction in Russia that we just don’t understand, it’s something in the lines of: I don’t give a shit about any one else, and they won’t give a shit about me. They don’t care about some else at all and just want to fly under the radar. It’s a thing that’s been this way for a long time because of the regimes that’s been in place there for so long.
