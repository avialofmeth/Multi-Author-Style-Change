I'm betting it's that the voters don't care. They want her to claim she lost by fraud so that she can win, not because they believe she lost by fraud, but because winning is better than losing. Moving on to running again in the same democratic system that "defrauded" her the last time is consistent with a belief-free ideology. This is the simplest explanation.
