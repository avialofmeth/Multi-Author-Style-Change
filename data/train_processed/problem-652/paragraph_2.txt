The US does not trade beef AT ALL with the EU due to Mad Cow disease. We are the largest exporter of beef in the world and the second largest importer after China. 3/4 of the countries in the world import US beef. Someone sold you some real BS. EU ban (3 decades ago) was over hormones not sanitation. It was proven false.
