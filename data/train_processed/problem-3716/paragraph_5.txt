I'm not saying this to insinuate Poland should act in one day or another concerning jets to Ukraine ( although, I wish they would give them a squadron) just to point out that they would have whatever they need for defense of their people. Also, it doesn't matter anyway. pootin doesn't pick on countries that can fight back, he just made a grave miscalculation with the Ukrainians!
