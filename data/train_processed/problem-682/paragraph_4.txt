We could have inflation drop to 0% and most Republicans would still think inflation is high and creating severe burdens for them. Republicans in particular consistently view economic conditions through a hyper-partisan lens. The stock market soared under Obama but most Republicans think it either dropped or stayed flat. Most Republicans think Trump was great on jobs despite weaker growth during his first 3 years compared to Obama's last 3. Jobs under Biden are outstanding so far.
