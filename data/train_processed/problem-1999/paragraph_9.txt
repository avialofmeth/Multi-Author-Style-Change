If you are talking about Romneycare, that was never a good label - the bill was passed by strong liberal supermajorities in the state legislature, and Romney (who was then genuinely acting as one of those centrist or even liberal leaning northeastern RINO governors - he moved a lot to the right in his 2012 presidential run) only reluctantly signed the bill, while vetoing various parts of it (those vetoes were overridden by the state legislature).
