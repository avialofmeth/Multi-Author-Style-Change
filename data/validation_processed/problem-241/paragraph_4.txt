In almost all instances, the findings of the arbitrator(s) are "final and binding", i.e., non-appealable. You cannot ask a court to modify or reverse an arbitration finding; the court wouldn't hear the case. The only action most courts will take re: an arbitration finding is to enforce it if a party is failing or refusing to adhere.
