The only good that can come of this is that it ought to destroy the facade that DeSantis's anti-woke laws are about anything other than thoughtcrime. My concern is that that may have been the goal. If Republicans still cared enough to use dog whistles, he would've waited until the textbook was released, then found some facts in the textbook that weren't unanimously agreed to be accurate (every history textbook is going to have some information that is disputed by some experts) then banned the curriculum on that basis. The fact that he felt no need to wait indicates that his people will honestly excuse exceedingly thinly veiled bigotry.
