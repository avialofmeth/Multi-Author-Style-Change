I disagree, people miss boxes on government forms all the time. The rule in Pennsylvania is that ballots must be received by 8pm on election day. Thousands of people met that rule. The government is suppressing vote-by-mail using a loophole. A dating error does not match the severity of the consequence, which is eliminating large blocks of voters from choosing a candidate. So the onus is on the government to make this correction, in my opinion.
