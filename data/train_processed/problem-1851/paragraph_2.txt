Trump liked to brag about how he could walk down fifth Ave, murder someone and never be convicted. He clearly never heard or read about John Gotti aka the Teflon King. Nothing stuck, till it did and he died in jail doing life. This reversal and his taxes being handed over and.... yea, the next house can shut it down, but there are too many other avenues on which to take it.
