According to an article I read some time ago, the one thing the US has a clear advantage in is nuclear submarines, beyond that, many things among the major world militaries are the same. There isnâ€™t quite a clear advantage from one to the next, but the nuclear submarines seem to be the most technologically advanced piece of US hardware versus an aircraft carrier, which now seems more like an asset then an actual war machine. WW2 was a much different war then any current one. The only clear advantage the Japanese had over the US was masking their approach to Pearl Harbor and some of the surprise attacks on the other Islands.
