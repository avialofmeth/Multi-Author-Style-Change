Yea, I'm breaking it down. I'm on the level of grammar and semantics. I don't care if you find it pedantic and useless. I'm a writer so I pay attention to these things. If I start writing shitty sentences, it will result in shitty paragraphs. Which will result in shitty pages. Which will result in shitty chapters. Which will result in shitty work. Got it?
