Also worth noting that any benefits to blue states are waste, but benefits to red states are vital. Just see the screeching when NJ and NY needed funds after Hurricane Sandy, then KY and TX pretending they had to play hardball with Biden to get money after their natural disasters. In reality, money for that stuff is already ear-marked and they fully know that.
