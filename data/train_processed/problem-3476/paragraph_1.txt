The IRS went for decades trying NOT to target the low hanging fruit. The problem is after 20-30 years of consistent budget cuts and demonization, they literally don't have the resources to target high earners and corporate entities. But they need to do something, so under the Trump admin they stopped trying to target the wealthy and just went after middle class cases because getting something done was better than nothing. Hiring more agents and lawyers allows them to refocus on the largest offenders of tax fraud again, hence why the Biden admin pushed for funding the IRS.
