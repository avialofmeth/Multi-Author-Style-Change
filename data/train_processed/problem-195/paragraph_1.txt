There are a lot of cases like hers I could imagine feeling differently about, but this lady can get bent. She has never expressed a shred of remorse, she has dual citizenship and isn't stateless, and 16 (when she left to join ISIS) isn't too young to figure out that she was joining a pack of murderers. By all accounts that was the draw for her and her lack of remorse and regret for anything other than her own situation only reinforces that.
