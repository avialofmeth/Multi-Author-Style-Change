It´s interesting because while growing up, every single time I have been bothered in the street, threatened for a cigaret, threatened for the keys of my scooter, threatened because I allegedly stared at them, it was always young dudes from North Africa. Never an Asian, never a European or a South American or a Hindi. I don’t say that everybody should be put in the same bag, I just say that it’s quite a coincidence that it’s always the same who create problems for no reasons.
