They basically convinced people that poor people will have their doors kicked down by the IRS wielding guns. Even tho the policy is specifically targeted at wealthy people, they just lie. I mean it would be comical to me too if i didn’t live in America. As long as it’s the opposite of what liberals want, no matter how fair or good for the country, they oppose it. They have almost no policies but to oppose liberals positions. Yet then spin it all as they love freedom.
