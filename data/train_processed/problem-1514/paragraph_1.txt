Even if that specific money wasn't being stolen by Taliban, it is essentially subsidizing Taliban. Since they took control of the country by force, it is their fucking responsibility to take care of those people. If NGOs are doing it for them, that means Talibans gets to focus on its terrorist shit and has the country kept fed and stable for them by the NGOs. After all the circlejerk about how supporting the deeply flawed yet still democratic and non-terrorist Afghan government was a waste of money and thus it was okay to abandone them, turning around to keep flooding the country with resources when Taliban is in charge never made any sense.
