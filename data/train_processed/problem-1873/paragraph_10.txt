Of course, I immediately thought of Greene and the other idiots on the right. It's sad, but true. We only think of Greene because of the stupid things she says. If she advocated for the positions she supports right now, but didn't say idiotic things (perhaps disguising the stupidity of her positions in rational sounding arguments), we likely wouldn't know her name at all.
