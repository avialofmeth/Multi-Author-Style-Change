racism and classism are centuries-old grifts that can always be tapped by those cynical and shitty enough to be willing to. It's the lowest of low-hanging fruit. If people had any sense they'd be in the hangover phase, damning Trump and themselves for falling so easily for it. But that's the beauty of this grift. All you have to do is whip up that hate and fear of the The Other and boom, it reinforces it, concentrates it.
