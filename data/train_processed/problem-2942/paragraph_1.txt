No, it’s far broader. “any visual depiction, … or any other form of depiction of explicit sexual conduct.” The “of explicit sexual” qualifier, as written, only modifies “any other form of depiction.” Without qualification, then, any visual depiction whatsoever would be considered child pornography: drivers license photos, passport photos, US currency, postage stamps, the crayon drawing your kid made that’s hanging on the fridge, product packaging, a picture of Jesus holding a lamb, everything. Aside from the intent, this is just astonishingly poorly written.
