Anecdote: I did contract work for a company a few years ago and some of the material involved was fairly confidential (their db schemas, client records, etc.). I obviously had to sign an NDA, but in addition - there were incredibly strict handling procedures. One of which I remember vividly: all company material was to be maintained at all times. This meant when I was done, it was to be returned. When I needed something - I was responsible for it. If I lost something (I never did, but a colleague did) he was sued - and lost.
