It is crazy to think that none of this had to happen. There was absolutely no reason other than to appease one man’s ego. The world as a whole had so much to deal with already, including a pandemic, and a spoiled dictator who wants for nothing decided he had had enough peace and started a whole war that didn’t need to happen. Now, whole bloodlines are decimated, billions upon billions of damages are done that will take decades to undo, millions of people are traumatized, and we have no idea when we will see the end of this war.
