Nice to hear from a Georgia resident! Yes, this is shaping up to be a SO close - if current polling is accurate. I donâ€™t have any suggestions on how to message to voters, but midterm races usually draw voters who are party loyalists. Those are the folks who turnout. That could be part of the reason why republican voters are supporting a candidate who is not traditional.
