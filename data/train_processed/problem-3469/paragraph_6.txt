It's more than that. The full Senate, in the first hours, hold a series of votes on the rules. Since the Constitution gives each chamber of the Congress the ability to create their own rules of decorum and procedure, the best time to change those rules is when the new session starts. Those changes to rules starting out would not be subject to the shenanigans like secret holds and the filibuster. They are straight yea/nay/abstain votes...and requires a simple majority to pass.
