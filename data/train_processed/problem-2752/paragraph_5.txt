More deals were done, gas supplies were found, industries started switching to electricity instead of gas, people turned their heating down, gas usage dropped over 20%, gas storage around the continent went up incredibly fast and hit max level, and we've now successfully negotiated the first major cold snap without issues. Gas levels remain high (in fact some countries increased), and recent reports have industry doing pretty well. Also, China's suffering serious problems with Covid and demand has slackened there also.
