I didn't say China was going to outnumber the US navy, I said it's building it's navy during a time period where the US navy is going to be shrinking for awhile. So it's still the best time window China is likely to see for awhile whether you want to compare them by numbers, tonnage, spending, VLS cells, or any other metric you'd like to use. And the ships they're building aren't just a bunch of weak trash. The Type 055, 052D, and 054A are respectable combatants.
