TikTok has been feeding me tons more information on East Palestine that is more detailed and less sensationalized or dumb as what Fox News and even the major nightly news shows. Often they just cover the horse race of it and don't get into the specifics. TikTok even once gave me a video aboit how in China most pvc is made without transporting vinyl chloride at all. Something it seems we should probably be doing.
