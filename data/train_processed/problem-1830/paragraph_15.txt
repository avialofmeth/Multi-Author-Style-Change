Wow a bachelors in computer science I imagine? Surely that gives you an all-encompassing view of the world. You probably know many syntax. I don't have a computer science degree and I can use that tool to dabble with code as long as I know what my objective is. It can even help me define it down into smaller chunks and write very efficiently. You should really be concerned.
