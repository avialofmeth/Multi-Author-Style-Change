in all honesty. if people would see the effect or their doings, like boycotting the world cup mayn more would do. many jsut dont do it because they always think their boycott would not change anything and thats why they jut dont do it. its the same with environmental pollution or just throwing some garbage onto the street. very shotsighted but thats how majority of people are.
