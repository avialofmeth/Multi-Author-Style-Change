I don't think it should be just the US in any case, since they've been criticised many times for being the "world police" (so, to turn around and ask for help now is a little disingenuous). It could be Canada, except that our peace enforcement capabilities have greatly atrophied and we'd need extra help. The French have the ability and the responsibility to act given the history of Haiti, but the current right wing government is unlikely to do so.
