Nowhere did I say they deserve to die or anything similar. It's fucked up to see men having grenades dropped on their heads, while they are probably there against their will but I'm not putting them as victims in the same basket as Ukrainian soldiers and civilians (this is why I responded to particular comment). Initially we thought it's Putin's war, but apparently more than enough people supports it and as I've mentioned they just don't want to be a part of it. It's easy to support war from comfort of your own four walls but it's another story when you're in foxhole being bombed at. Either way, it's a tragedy for humanity for what it is.
