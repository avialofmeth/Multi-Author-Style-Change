theres politically left leaning people like myself that call themselves centrists too. despite being a lifelong (since i could register to vote i mean) democrat and never once voting for anything republican. jusssayin... it's broad politcally. just because someone is a centrist doesn't make them a libertarian or right wing necessarily.
