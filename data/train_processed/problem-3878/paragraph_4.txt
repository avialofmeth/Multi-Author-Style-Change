Typically in the highlands and west coast, your farmland is used for sheep and cows. The sheep love the terrain and thus you see mostly sheep in those areas. I knew a Shepard who took me on a walk around the west coast to tend to his sheep - sheep can basically use a mountainside that's totally inaccessible to machinery as farmland. It's cool seeing them live in that semi-wild state.
