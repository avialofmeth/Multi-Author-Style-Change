Everywhere else I look, /r/conservative, Fox News comments, Breitbart comments, quotes from conservative talk radio, pretty much anywhere you might be exposed to right-wing thought processes unfiltered ... you wouldn't believe it's the same group of people. The vast majority of the actual right-wing propaganda machine ... it's like they all decided at once that it was time. That it was a big electoral loss that did it rather than an attempted coup is depressing, but it would be difficult to claim that it's surprising.
