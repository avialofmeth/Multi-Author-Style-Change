Kleptocrats frequently have one big weakness: no succession plan. Putin doesn't have an obvious successor, because he doesn't trust anyone to shield him should he step down. This would make the inner circle of any dictator nervous, because a dead leader surprise could easily lead to a mad dash for power, which would leave many elites out of power, if not dead. I wouldn't be surprised if Putin's circle in particular has a contingency plan to oust Putin on their terms, should he not announce a successor.
