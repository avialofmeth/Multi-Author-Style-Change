Did you visit outside the rich cities? Most places are like hellholes, poor, isolated and full of garbage and misery. Many are unemployed, addicts and/or have HIV. The rest are alcoholics that get hammered every day with cheap russian vodka. There is no future for anyone. A total misery of a country. The wealth is concentrated around moscow and st.petes.
