I think Russia is in a similar situation as Germany in 1943, before or after Kursk... On paper it's still strong (in numbers German army peaked in 1943), but its strategy has failed, its best troops have been eliminated, it has lost the momentum, it can't sue for peace because of the stubbornness of the leader, its increasing difficulties are hidden by even more hostile rhetorics, it has problems with logistics etc. The only thing missing are the bombings of the home front.
