Tax cuts for billionaires off of every other American's back, yet again. Being buddy, buddy with Russia and China as well as N. Korea. A cabinet full of the worst the far right had to offer. The only president to organize his own coup cause he couldn't handle the loss, that poor fragile ego. Saying he wasn't taking a salary as a nod to him not doing it for the money but then staying at his own resorts charging a hell of alot more than multiple salaries combined. He grifted the entire term, pure tax dollars in his pocket. The man made a fortune selling us out, he accomplished squat outside his own interest and those of the super wealthy.
