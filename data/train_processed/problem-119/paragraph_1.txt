They could definitely make ultimatums about leaving ukraine, not attacking civilian infrastructure or actively protecting areas in Ukraine. Operating purely defensively and if civilian infrastructure attacked then russian units abroad would pay the price. The notion that Russia would go nuclear at any moment, is the FUD Russia has intended and succeeded in cultivating within the west so they can get away with everything. Just like before the invasion, most European countries were resigned to doing nothing if Russia attacked Ukraine and took over, because they thought themselves powerless. And now, the same shit is setting in again, all the while the risk of nuclear contamination from shelling nuclear plants goes up with zero repercussions for Russia.
