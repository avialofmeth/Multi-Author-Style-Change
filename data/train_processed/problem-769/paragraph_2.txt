My own family had farms since the mid 19th century until recently. We just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. It sucks paying high grocery bills but food costs money to grow. A lot. It is such an odd market arrangement; if there were some high tech wizardry that was as fundamentally critical to life itself we would gladly pay through the nose for it.
