India has argued that singling out one type of fossil fuel and labelling it as harmful while promoting and accepting the use of other fossil fuels is not based on facts. There is an equity aspect to it as well. Coal use is mostly concentrated in developing countries while use of gas is more prevalent in rich industrialised countries. Singling out coal puts a bigger burden on poor developing countries while giving countries with greater resources more leeway in planning out their transition to clean energy.
