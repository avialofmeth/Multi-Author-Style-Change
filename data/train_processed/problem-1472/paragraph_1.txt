There is no way in hell they are going to say that the libel laws are unconstitutional. If you want to completely ignore the fact that it would be the greatest upheaval in the history of the theory of law, think of it this way: if the libel laws were deemed unconstitutional, anyone and any company could say anything about anyone or any company without any repercussions. There would be so much chaos as corporate commercial warfare began that everyone of the shareholders and executives would be losing money. This would not fly.
