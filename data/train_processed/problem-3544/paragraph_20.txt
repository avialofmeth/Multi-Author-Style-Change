I'm less opinionated than you think. Just because I'm not freaking out doesn't mean I favor it. Checks on the court are correct in theory even if I disagree with the proposed method. If you couldn't tell, I'm in favor of super majority checks. I just don't think it's a huge deal and the people still have a direct check on those that could abuse the check.
