I am voting by absentee ballot instead of early voting. Problems there, too. I requested my ballot two days after the election. It was finally mailed today, 18 days later. Now it has 10 days to (a) get to me, (b) get filled out, and (c) make it back to Georgia and be received by the election office. If it doesn't make it, my vote won't count. Even if nothing else goes wrong, I'll have to pay for priority or next day mail to be sure it arrives on time.
