Just open the door of the apartment (only if you can safely) if you are on the upper floors when it happens because the movement will screw with the door frame and can leave you unable to leave the apartment. That said, considering the historical record I don't think an earthquake there can create that much movement to deform the frames unless you get one that breaks the pattern.
