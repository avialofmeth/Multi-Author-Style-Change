All of these assholes make the most ridiculous statements pushing their Russo-centric ideals. Some of them prob even believe it but mostly it’s for domestic propaganda consumption. If Putin is ousted none of these people should be allowed a place in the new government. Recently heard many think Prigozhin is positioning himself as a rival to Putin. Him getting power would a worse case scenario. I think he’d just empty the prisons of the worst (without asking said prisoners this time) to throw in the meat grinder and wouldn’t put it past him to use nukes or dirty bombs. Tho with him making derogatory statements against Putin lately I wouldn’t be surprised if he falls out of window to his death soon.
