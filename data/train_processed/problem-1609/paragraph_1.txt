People forget that the last thing China wants to do is enter a war, it would destroy their country. They have a lot of bluster but something like 85% (Don't quote me on this being exact) of their trade income comes from the West. Something around 7% comes from Russia. They are also a massive net importer of food, their country would starve. If they split from the West their economy tanks in a historical fashion. What is most logical is they want to keep good ties with Russia so that they can be a cheap source of resources, especially food - so they can stop relying on the West for food imports. Once they have a cheaper supply of critical resources they can start working to destabilize the petrodollar. China's expansion policy has been through monetary means and not military might.
