Thank you for saying this. I was once asked in an interview if I had ever worked with difficult people. My answer was this: Everybody has bad days, including me. I want to give teammates the same grace they give me for being imperfect. If there's someone I don't particularly like, then that's my red flag to look in the mirror. I tend to dislike people who have characteristics that I'm not able to see in myself. Additionally, we can tell a lot about a person by the kinds of insults they hurl at others and the bits of our culture that they rail against. \[edited because there's a loose nut behind the keyboard\].
