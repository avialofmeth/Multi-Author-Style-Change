From a Serbian perspective : shit got fucked up in the '90s,now every single ex-Yu politician is milking that. Every elections you have "crisis" of "unprecedented" risk. Nothing is going to happen, nothing is ever going to happen and/or change. Plus, this is a distraction from real problems. Bread and games. If you want in depth analysis, feel free to dm me.
