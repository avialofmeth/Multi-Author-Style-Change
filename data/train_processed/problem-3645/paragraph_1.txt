Agreed wholeheartedly. From experience, sometimes you’ll get the more extroverted individuals who toss out politically-charged jokes without knowing the listener’s affiliation, but in the vast majority of cases, they just assume your have similar beliefs as they do, and in the off chance they find out you don’t, the usual response is a bit of awkward silence followed by changing of topic, or some self-deprecating joke as a follow up.
