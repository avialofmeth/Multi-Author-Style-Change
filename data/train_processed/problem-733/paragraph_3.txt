To clarify: we are all born into circumstances we cannot control. Most of us are born into some form of slavery, be it wage slavery or something more extreme. The systems in place have been in place for a very long time with the goal of extracting the maximum output with the least resistance, and to keep everyone feeling powerless, divided, and in fear. Rising up is not so easy, and can mean losing everything. This is fear, but justified fear. It is not stupidity. The system protects itself - recognizing it is not sufficient to defeat it, any more than seeing the chains will magically break them. Seeing them is the first step, and even this is difficult for many people for a variety of reasons, almost all of which are not their fault.
