Bangladesh can choose to ignore that and say it's not so, that she was a UK citizen. But that will open an entirely new can of worms as to the status of Bangladeshi citizenship abroad ( which seems to be what the British government is also trying to set up a contest for. ). Because there are many people who are also dual Bangladesh/whatever citizens that haven't applied for dual citizenship because of how lax the Bangladeshi rules are.
