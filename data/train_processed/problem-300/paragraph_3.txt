The villages and towns that get targeted by our forces are most of the time evacuated and being used by the Russian military, so they can’t claim that we are targeting civilians. It’s funny how they were accusing us of using civilians as shields while we were protecting our cities from being overrun by the Russian horde, but then they turn around and do the exact thing they were accusing us of.
