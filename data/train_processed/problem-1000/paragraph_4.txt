I've recently read about Thierry Baudet mentioning the Reptilians, so I'd say we're not there yet, but yeah the guy has gone completely nuts and somewhat joined Fran√ßois Asselineau (UPR) in this niche. He recently supported Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, another right-wing sovereignist turned into a supporter of Didier Raoult and hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic.
