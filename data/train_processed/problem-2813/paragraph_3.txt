Oddly enough the only place they don’t see pedophiles are the places where there actually are pedophiles. Show me the last time a drag queen or a democrat was busted for pedophilia? Because I can get you a dozen Republican politicians and Christian priests who’ve been busted for it. But family values, am I right?
