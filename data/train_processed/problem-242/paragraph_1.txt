From what reporting I've seen (mainly BBC coverage), the Ukrainians are much better at battlefield medicine than the Russians. They're good at retrieving wounded from the front lines, bringing them to field hospitals, and stabilizing them so that they survive. But that doesn't mean that those soldiers can return to the fight. If a guy gets his leg or arm blown off by artillery, field hospitals can make sure he doesn't die, but he's not getting back into the fight, like, ever. So Ukrainian casualties (soldiers rendered incapable of service due to either death or injury) is likely much higher than the plain death toll.
