The fight in Mississippi mirrors similar battles between White state lawmakers in deep red states and the leadership of Black-run cities in other parts of the country. A similar fight is shaping up in Missouri, where a bill has been introduced that would give the governor power to strip the authority of any elected prosecutor to handle violent crime cases. Last year, Tennessee lawmakers attempted to take over the finances of the majority Black small town of Mason, which is expected to see an economic boost from a new Ford plant being built nearby.
