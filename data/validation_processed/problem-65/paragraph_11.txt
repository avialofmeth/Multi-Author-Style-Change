Then there are freak accidents. One vehicle was destroyed and two adjacent vehicles had significant damage when a bolt of lightning punched through the roof of the warehouse to strike the vehicle. I guess the chemicals used to maintain the oxygen-less atmosphere also somehow caused the accumulation of static electricity? Who knows. All I know is that was the first time I saw the vehicle's inch and a half thick top armor plating bent open and torn off the vehicle along the weld lines.
