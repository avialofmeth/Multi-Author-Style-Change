We need open borders asap. I want to see massive immigration to the United States. In fact I want to see the U.S government pay for fleets of buses to bring economic immigrants here at a rapid pace. I also want the government to pay for their housing. Every single person that walks into this country should get citizenship. Could you imagine a billion people living in this country. All that wasteful land that animals live on can be turned to suburbs. I'm not joking about any of the above.
