Not quite but kind of. As the laws are written these berry pickers aren't picking on private land but public land, these are "forest berries." The companies sell the berry pickers services (accommodations, transportation, food, etc.) and the berry pickers sell them berries. As the law is written the berry pickers can choose whoever they want to sell to. But obviously it's easier to sell to the people you own debt to because then they can resolve your accounts faster. It also means these companies are more likely to invite you back next year to berry pick again using their accommodations.
