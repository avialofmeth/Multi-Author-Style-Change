Rammed both of them into massive storms. It's such a shame. Zeppelins could see submarines at periscope depth, so not one ship was ever attacked by a sub while in sight of an airship or balloon. A couple of those flying aircraft carriers would have been real useful in the Atlantic during the early stages of World War II. And you know that airships would have gotten tons of investment over the 30s and 40s. Don't know if they would have survived jets and radar, but I am sad that I'm not in the timeline with badass flying aircraft carriers in World War II.
