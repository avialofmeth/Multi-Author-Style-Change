Ironically, when I was last in Russia, the window at my accommodation (Soviet-era apartments) was so badly made that you could see many warps in the glass from manufacturing. Sub-standard glue wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. It's not what happened here (obvs.), but low quality products aren't uncommon.
