Well he’s savvy enough to remain in power this long. It’s easy to dismiss these autocrats as being pantomime bad guys who needn’t be taken seriously, like Gaddafi for example, but if you look at how well they were able to read a room politically in order to get power it’s impressive. Like, at the end of the day, _they ARE running nations_. I don’t know about Lukashenko, but he would have had to know who were his rivals and enemies, what they wanted, how he could buy their support, and how to maintain leadership for decades. You’d have to be able to do that and know how to continually monitor the politics of your political rivals and society otherwise you’d never get a decent nights sleep for fear of being assassinated.
