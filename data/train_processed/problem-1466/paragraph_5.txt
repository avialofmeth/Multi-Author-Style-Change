My mom has been a Republican her entire life (she’s 50 so young enough to know better) and when I told her that Republican candidates were anti-choice she wouldn’t believe me and said that i must believe in a conspiracy. She said all of her Republican friends are pro-choice so that wouldn’t make any sense. I guess what I’m saying is that you really can’t underestimate how low-info these voters are, they have no idea what’s going on. It’s a sports team to them.
