Thats hillarious as being Woke is being American. The definition of woke is " aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice) " . So if you are anti-woke then you are actively turning a blind eye to societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice). In America we fight for the rights, equality, and justice for all citizens and work to be a melting pot. Thus understanding the issues your fellow Americans face and working to ensure justice for them as well as yourself, is American.
