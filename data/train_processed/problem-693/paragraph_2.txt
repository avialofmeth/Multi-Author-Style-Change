Too often Assistants were overburdened with Residents. They dealt with incontinence, dementia, preventing falls, bathing, turning among catering to the many requests by Residents, having fifteen to eighteen. There are regulations relating from to how often people are bathed to the ratio of Resident/Assistants. It is very difficult work. I imagine these Senators would not like the Assistant to Resident ratio be dictated among other cost saving measures. If they actually want to improve Nursing Homes situations, I would be happy. But I rather think they want to dictate rules to reopen Nursing Homes which and reduce quality of care. I wish they would address concerning issues such as many NH are managed by private money-making corps. They make it difficult to determine who owns them. Nursing Homes are a concerning issue that does need to be addressed FULLY.
