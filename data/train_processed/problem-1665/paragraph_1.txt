I'm nice so I'll explain myself to a loser troll. What I mean by "beyond left and right" is that one's political stance takes a back seat when 1) a terrorist organization passes a law legalizing the use of nukes to your country and 2) there exists a political party that is known to take money from said terrorists to create underground organizations as well as supporting policies that fund the Kim regime with tax payer money.
