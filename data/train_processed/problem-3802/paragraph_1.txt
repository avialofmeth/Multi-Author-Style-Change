Well known liar Boris Johnson, makes claim that no one can verify or backup, in order to further his agenda and make himself look good... Where have I seen that happen before? oh yes, his entire journalist career where he has been fired from multiple places for submitting totally fabricated articles and quotes and lying to his superiors in order to further his own agenda. Then his entire time in government leading up to his premiership where he was fined for lying and was eventually ousted by his own party for the same thing because he lied so much he made their brand toxic!
