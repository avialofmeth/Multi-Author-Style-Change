No one gives a damn about Bari Weiss, who is only relevant because powerful people keep her vapid viewpoints elevated. I've seen excerpts of this puff piece (which is essentially regurgitated from the half dozen PR pieces already put out about her) and it's laughably uncompelling. Like the author pulls a quote from Chapo Trap House where they are talking about her "University" down in Texas and how they are calling it vapid and fake and nothing there - as if an example of how she has wrongheaded haters. Then is forced to admit in the next paragraph that yeah the "university" doesn't really exist. Like imagine making Chapo look good, that takes serious effort.
