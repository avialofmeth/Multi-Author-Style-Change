It's really amazing how these bottom-of-the-barrel chucklefucks like Ali, Kirk, and Shapiro are the cream of the crop of right-wing thought leaders, along with Jordan, Gaetz, and Taylor-Greene in Congress. How anyone can listen to them for more than five minutes and not see right through them is beyond me.
