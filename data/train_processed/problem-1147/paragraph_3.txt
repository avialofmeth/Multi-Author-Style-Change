They've never cared about Russia's wellbeing before, why start now? Russia can be useful to authoritarian dictators who need someone with a decent-sized army to kick the shit out of protesters, but other than that, it's like living next door to a flop house. If you're lucky, they'll just be noisy, if you're unlucky, the junkies next door will break into your house and steal your shit when you're not home, if you're really unlucky, they'll decide they like your house better than theirs and just move in. But at no point will you ever be glad that they're there, nor would you ever mourn their passing.
