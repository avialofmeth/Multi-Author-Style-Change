Violence against anybody is never good and not right. But what has been happening with these tribals is that these people are indigenous and have no notion of any religion. Missionaries just fool them with scare tactics or give them some freebies and convert them. And they also go as far as scaring them that the lord will strike them with vengeance if they go on the path of sin by reconverting! I wish people follow their religion without trying to convert every pagan, sinner, infidel into their choice of religion... It's like my path is the path of righteousness and you are on the wrong path..
