Also I'm not saying take it by force, I'm talking a negotiated agreement. I was thinking starting really small. What if the border was moved so a ten by ten block area was now in DR instead of Haiti? It seems like over time, the DR could easily handle instituting basic services like power/water/trash removal/mail, etc. They could open a grocery store there using DR logistics routes, they could pave the streets, offer medical care and after a generation, the education and stability of that one neighborhood would have improved greatly with no negative impact on DR, right?
