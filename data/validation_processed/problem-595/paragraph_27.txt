Yes, but China also claims international waters as its territory. The fact is that when you have specious and completely arbitrary territorial “claims” on 18 other countries’ legal domains, you are the problem. China’s alleged territorial disputes with India and Bhutan are complete hogwash, and simply a cover for the CCP’s broader hegemonic designs and unwarranted aggression.
