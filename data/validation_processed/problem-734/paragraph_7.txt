We need to expand the judiciary 3 fold across the board. The SCOTUS should have 28 justices, yes twenty eight. There should be 4 courts of 7 and the makeup of each court should be randomly selected from the pool of 28 at the start of each annual term. This will help prevent gaming the court because you never know who will be in which court or which of the four courts your case will end up in.
