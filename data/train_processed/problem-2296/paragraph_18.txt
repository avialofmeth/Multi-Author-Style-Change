There's also that most religious people are still people. And even people who don't support gay marriage aren't actually hateful all the time. My father(who I'm no contact with because his wife is transphobic and my wife is trans) sees marriage as a religious institution. But when gay marriage was the 'it issue' didn't vote for the anti gay marriage guy, because he was a hateful nutter, and instead voted for the gay(he is closeted but it was very much an open secret, people have actually outed him by accident because they didn't know he was 'closeted') candidate. For those sorts of people this bill is probably exactly what they want.
