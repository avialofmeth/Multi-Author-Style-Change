Like, Jordan Peterson tried to scaremonger about the "300 million a year industry", like that's a huge number or something. That includes the surgeries, the whole kit and kaboodle. Hair plugs alone make 10 billion a year; the entire market with drugs and all is twice the size at 18 billion. The difference between 10 billion and 300 million is about 10 billion. We're a fucking rounding error to big pharma.
