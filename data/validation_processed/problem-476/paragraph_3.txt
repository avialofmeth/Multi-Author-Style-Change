They don't have enough shells, they are resorting to NK and Iran for help, Russia the second biggest military force is re-buying their own stockpiles of equipment sold to North Korea 30 or 50 years ago. So not a chance my dear friend. And if they buy equipment made in North Korea I expect even worse quality controls than Russia itself.
