I actually think NATO should call Russia out, get a UN investigation started and make the findings public. The level of incompetent malice of Russia must be shown to the world. Russia will not back down, this is exactly what happened during Malaysian airlines, even before any investigation Russia told it was not us, then used the usual FSB propaganda to cover it up.
