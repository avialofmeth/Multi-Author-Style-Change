Trump would’ve been a disaster. He was siding with Putin from way back, was anti NATO and had every appearance of literally being Putin’s stooge. He defended and praised him a year ago and again just recently stating he trusts Russian president Vladimir Putin more than the "lowlifes" who work in U.S. intelligence. He was a sellout to the USA and to Democracy itself.
