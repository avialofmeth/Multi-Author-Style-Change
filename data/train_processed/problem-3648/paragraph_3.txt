The story is that it has been revealed that a Belgian Stalinist is the person behind a network of fake news websites spreading Russian propaganda to French-speaking West Africans. The websites are ostensibly based in Africa and independent from each other but their purpose is to drum up African support for Russia, namely support for the Wagner and so on.
