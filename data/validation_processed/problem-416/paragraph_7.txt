Crazy part is, it'll work. The senate map is likely to really hurt Dems in '24, and if someone like DeSantis can emerge from primaries I have serious doubts the American people will realize how dangerous he is. They all get to keep positions despite being terrible at their jobs and not even putting a party platform together in '20 or '22, but the combination of American mouth-breathers, and our fetish for minority rule will be our undoing.
