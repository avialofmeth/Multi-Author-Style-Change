Biggest controversy imo was her accusing KMW and Rheinmetall that their Puma IFV really sucked because they "broke down". But slowly details emerged that the issues were extremely minor and pretty much are the fault of incompetent army soldiers. She changed her mind to still keep the IFV orders for the future but its very obvious she has no idea whats going and that theres a severe lack of transparency. Nobody wants another von der Leyen (remember the incredibly stupid G36 issue).
