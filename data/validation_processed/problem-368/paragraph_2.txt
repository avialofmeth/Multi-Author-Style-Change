In addition to your point I'd be surprised if animal control the Agricultural Promotion Division in Japan has quick access to firearms, especially the kind of rifle you need to safely bring down pissed off 175 pound wild boar. That may depend on the local wildlife situation though. When I lived there I remember seeing news about a problem bear that kept coming into a town in Hokkaido and they basically had a couple of designated bear hunters.
