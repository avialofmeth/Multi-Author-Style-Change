It's like an ex you've got serious history with - kids and shared property, say. Most of the time you're civil to each other, every so often it gets bitter and horrible for a while but you always manage to grit your teeth and get a working relationship going again because it'd just be disastrous if you didn't. Britain is currently sulking in the corner though sent some apology flowers to get everyone to help out their neighbour Ukraine. It's all fun and games until it turns vicious.
