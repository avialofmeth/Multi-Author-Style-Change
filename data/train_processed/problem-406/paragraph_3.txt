Iran and Iraq used during their war from 1980-1988. That war is also the only war since WWI where chemical warfare was used on the battlefield on a massive scale. They mostly used sarin but mustard gas was also deployed. Iran also made extensive use of "human wave attacks" across no-man's land which was also a WWI phenomenon. They even had bayonet charges. It was also the first time nuclear reactors were attacked. It's the first time two sides mutually lobbed ballistic missiles at each other.
