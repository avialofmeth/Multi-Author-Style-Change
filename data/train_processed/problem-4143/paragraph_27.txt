“We know from the analysis of the right outboard flap found on Kojani Island, Tanzania that this was not an attempted ditching, where the flaps would normally be extended because the expert analysis showed that the flaps were not extended. The realistic possibility that the landing gear was lowered shows both an active pilot and an attempt to ensure the plane sank as fast as possible after impact,” the report said.
