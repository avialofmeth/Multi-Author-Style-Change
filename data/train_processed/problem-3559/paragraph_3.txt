The answer is fascism! It's real easy to raise money when a) your citizenry and their families are punished for disobeying and b) you're targeting an established ethnic group for systematic extermination and can steal and/or sell off all of their accumulated wealth. See Japanese-Americans on the west coast circa WW2 for greater detail on the second point.
