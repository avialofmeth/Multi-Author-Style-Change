It's a no-brainer that these people are using them, simply because of the utility, GPS(!), and communication, plus they provide entertainment for people who could be out there doing literally nothing for hours. I do wonder if they'll suffer the same side effects of GPS tech that we do, though, where a lot of people have lost the ability to navigate and stopped learning streets/routes due to reliance on GPS, which isn't a bad thing for us but is a bit sad in the context of people that have been there in those lands for ages.
