Even if he becomes king it doesn’t mean he is is invincible- it’s just harder for his political enemies to get rid of him. King saud was forced into retirement after he lost political power despite him being a king. So contrary to popular belief kings also need to maintain political power to continue being kings. I don’t think MBS will stay if things get tough , he would flee the country the first chance he gets but until then he is here to stay. However, this is all built on the basis that the military will stay neutral like they always do. If they decide to intervene then this changes everything. Thank you for listening to my ted talk.
