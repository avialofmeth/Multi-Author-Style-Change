But rehabilitating prisoners has proved to be less expensive for society in the long run. Recidivism (repeating criminal behavior) is lessened for people who return to society with new skills and understanding. The police won't have to arrest this person again, the prosecutor won't have to build a case against them again, the judge won't have to try them again, the public defender won't have to represent them again, the prison won't have to house them again.... well, it's less likely anyway.
