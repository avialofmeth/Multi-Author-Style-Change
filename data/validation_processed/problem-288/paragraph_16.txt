It is the same reason you have yet to see charges for Trump or other corrupt politicians. Basically, you don't win elections especially at the federal level generally, unless you have some skeletons in your closet doesn't matter the side. Sure there are likely some exceptions to this people like AOC but for the most part this is true. Holding these people accountable even when it is a particularly erroneous example opens them all up for accountability. So they have decided collectively to protect each other.
