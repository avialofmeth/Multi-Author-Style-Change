More importantly I do not hate the swiss nor do I hate switzerland. I just find it very funny how many people love to point it out as a beacon of a perfect rich and accepting country whenever shitting on the US. When in reality it is a fairly xenophobic, anti Semitic and only does what is in its best interest.. just like everyone else.
