The factions or moieties thereof that are starting to break aren’t doing so out of the goodness of their own hearts but to save their own hides. Problem is, they all have conflicting goals and methods for doing so and are now working at cross purposes to each other. Yes, many want to double down on DeSantis, but not all of them and even if they can unanimously support him, I don’t think it will be enough to save them from what’s happening.
