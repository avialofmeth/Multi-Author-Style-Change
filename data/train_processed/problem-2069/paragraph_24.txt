While legally speaking Clinton did lie under oath and was subject to disciplinary action; we all know that every politician lies under oath in this country. Bernie may be the only one that doesn't and that's cause he's more in your face about truths. That being said, the American populace was naive and rather innocent. We didn't know the mechanics going on behind the scenes, and we thought politicians were for the most part truthful. We weren't as educated on the political lobbying, campaigning, and strategic planning as we are now.
