casualties would be massive on the russian side. russia wouldn’t be able to inflict casualties on the nato side, simply because it wouldn’t have the means to do so. russian air force is no match for nato air force, russian anti air would be destroyed either by stealthy planes or nato artillery which is more precise and out ranges the russian artillery. russian tanks would be destroyed from air. there wouldn’t even be much troop on troop engagement as russian equipment would just keep blowing up and they wouldn’t even know how or where the rounds or missiles are coming from. this won’t happen because nukes, but don’t kid yourself that there would be any kind of even matchup between nato/russia military.
