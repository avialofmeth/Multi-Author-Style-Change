Speak for yourself, there’s a warehouse in all major cities in the United State paying 20$-26$ a hour, health insurance less then 100$ a month, community college is 250$ a class federally subsidized loans FOR ANYONE no payments until graduation, and if your not down town rent is easily 1000-1500. It’s not perfect but anyone willing to go where the work is will live a middle class life.
