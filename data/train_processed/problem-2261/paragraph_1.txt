I reached out to the author of the paper on Twitter for an explanation. I’ll let you know what he says. I think he is netting out the impact of the energy used to make all the wind turbines and solar panels. Like, if you get 10% of the energy from renewables but your using 1/2 of that energy just to make the solar panels and wind turbines then the net benefit would be 5%. But I’ll find out.
