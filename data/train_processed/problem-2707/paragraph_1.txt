Some of it is totally valid. Like, the 'defending the skies' part is irrelevant as any bomber planes would be taken down before they even got near the mainland to need AA, and if were talking icbm's, almost everyone would be SOL. But yeah, it's been chronically underfunded and understaffed, and isn't a top tier armed forces. It's also comparing to armed forces of countries considered superpowers - those days are long gone for the uk, it would never be on par with the numbers then can field.
