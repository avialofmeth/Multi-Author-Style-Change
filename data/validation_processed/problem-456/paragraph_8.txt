It would be important if Europe held on with this war effort that Ukraine is sacrificially fighting for our interest, but particulary that our on-duty saviour, daughter-turned-parent: the USA holds this line and that trumpist republicans do not turn the policy around. Any outcome that would give Putinâ€™s Russia any territory is a reward for the regime, a prolongation of the threat from Russia to the West - European Union, immediate russian neughbourhood that has aspirations to join the democratic world. This failure (in cost of life and resources) has radicalised Russian public even more and any victory they could take out of this would only worsen their mentality towards dangerous in future. The only way is defeating them so they realise they were fcuked by their leader. Their mentality will remain problematic but theere will be a possibility of self-reflection and preocupation with problems within the federation that would have to be resolved would kerp Russia out of our hair. Like the US led strategy (after complete EU, then ECC, failure to address balkan wars) did with Serbian regime.
