It sounds wimpy, but many people have just succumbed to live as it is here. Ohio is a working state, with not a lot to do outside of job prospects. We also have a decently high boomer population in comparison to our general population, many of whom who haven’t left the workforce yet, meaning it can be hard to progress career-wise. That also means most of these (often conservative) older people vote against our best interest to “keep things as they should be.”.
