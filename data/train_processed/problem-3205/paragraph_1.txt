Conservatives (anyone who would vote for any of the current Republican politicians) have no standards.They're voting for team force-our-mental-limitations-on-everyone-else(fascism). Selfishness in all facets is their defining characteristic. They don't even think about it because it's clear who the bad guys are: anyone who exposes them to the terror of a reality that is incongruous with their programmed beliefs. When all your stated goals are nefarious because ignoring reality has nefarious results, underhanded and malevolent representatives who will cheat are preferrable. They have no problem lying, voting for pedophiles, con artists, foreign assets, religious whackjobs, and anyone else who will superficially tell them that they are right to be bad people.
