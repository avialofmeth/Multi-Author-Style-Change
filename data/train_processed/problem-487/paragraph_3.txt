Just going to confirm what you're saying is accurate - thanks for the thoughtful reply. But I also want to point out that the 712 page pdf we found is only part of the full report, which is over 6,000 pages according to Wikipedia. So just to play devil's advocate it is true in this case that we don't know what we don't know.
