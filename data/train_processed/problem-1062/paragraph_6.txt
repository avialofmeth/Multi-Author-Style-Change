Is it really "peace time" when Russia has declared a holy war against the West threatening to attack Nato countries, China is building up to invade Taiwan and threatening the US with war in case US were to interfere, North Korea is doing missile tests it claims are simulations attacks against the US and Iranian regime is acquiring nuclear weapons while its leader is promising death to America?
