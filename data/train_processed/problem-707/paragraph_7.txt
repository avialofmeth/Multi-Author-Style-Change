My brother works for the railroad. Railroad companies, like most, are making record profits. There is absolutely no reason workers shouldn’t have paid sick time, none. Rail workers are treated like total shit and our economy would crash without them. I hope they strike. Yes I know the cost, but so does everyone else and they don’t seem to care.
