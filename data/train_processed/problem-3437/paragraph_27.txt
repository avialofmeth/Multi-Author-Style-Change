News flash, most Russians never had them. And the prognosis of this war shows that Russians are not in fact going to do shit about their worsening living standards, just as they haven't for the past decade, nor over the entire course of the Soviet Union's existence. You are a fool to think Russian leadership will do anything for the people, whether it is Putin or Navalny. National populists in the West already are shit at giving people prosperity, in a system with far more checks and balances. And Navalny is at best a popular Nationalist.
