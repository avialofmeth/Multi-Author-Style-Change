Banning all tobacco is a bad idea for the same reason that alcohol prohibition was a bad idea. Banning an addictive substance doesn't get rid of demand; it just gets rid of the government's ability to regulate age, ingredients, etc, causing way more issues than if we simply regulate tobacco. You can see the same thing happening with marajuana (for a more modern example) where banning it didn't get rid of it; banning pot only got rid of the regulating power that the government had over it.
