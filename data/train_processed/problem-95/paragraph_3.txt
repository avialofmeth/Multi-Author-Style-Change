Even with all the documentation, I still feel like holocaust is underrated in terms of atrocities. Like I feel as though it isn’t talked about enough that the nazis were literally killing 16,000 innocent people (mostly Jewish but tons of other minorities too) DAILY. I don’t think people understand how many bodies that is. Not to mention the torture that the survivors went through. Or the fact that dying in a gas oven is torturous in itself.
