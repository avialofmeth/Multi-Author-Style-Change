I want to say it was around $37 per diem? I did a one-month work release sentence too and that was more cher. I want to say closer to $80/diem. Per what the other commenter linked, I guess I didnâ€™t have it too bad comparatively. I guess you could add the $15 per random weekly pre-trial UA to the unseen costs of being arrested too (frequency and price dependent on supervisor, alleged offense and testing location).
