Headlines should contain more qualifiers or details, but generally if they explain in the first paragraph it's not that bad. A headline is just meant to catch someone's eye and convey a bare bone statement. It can/should be inferred what they are talking about, to a degree. When a governing body like a state government is talking about banning a word, it has to do with the usage of that word within the jurisdiction of that area of government.
