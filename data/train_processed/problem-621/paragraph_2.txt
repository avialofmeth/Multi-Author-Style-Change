The comments section makes me cringe. The West claiming moral high ground is judging a nation that it has shunned for much of it's independent history. During every major conflict that India has been involved in, the West has basically said fuck you to India. Whether it was 1948, 1962, 1965 or 1971. In 1971 the US literally sent a carrier group to the Bay of Bengal to intimidate India into accepting genocide in modern day Bangladesh. You know who stood by India in those testing times? It was the former USSR. The situation is more complicated than you think. The West has squeezed all known sources of oil out of the market (Venezuela, Iran etc.). Most of the middle eastern oil is being diverted to the West to compensate for the lack of Russian energy. Where does India go for oil for it's 1.4 billion people?
