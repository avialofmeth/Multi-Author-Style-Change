There's just not the vehicle itself, either. There's all the spare parts and tools (not to mention computers) and ammunition. Mind you, that's just to fight with this thing. Something like a Leopard or an Abrams or a Bradley requires maintenance and repair, which is normally in itself a whole other bag of worms. All of this costs money.
