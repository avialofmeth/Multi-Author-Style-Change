Like who? McCarthy is consistently getting over 200 votes for six ballots now. The only one who has done better than that is Hakeem Jeffries, who has gotten 212 votes on each and every ballot. Anyone else has done no better than 20 votes (Jim Jordan on the third ballot, and Byron Donalds on the fourth through sixth ballots so far). So, is 20-vote Jim Jordan likely to become Speaker? Or is three-time 20-vote Byron Donalds? What's your evidence one of them will suddenly gain nearly 200 votes over their best showing so far? Or your reasoning for why that even might be so?
