Also if you look up the states most dependent on federal funding (meaning funding received compared to taxes paid) the top 10 is DOMINATED by Republican states. The reddest of the red tooâ€¦Mississippi, Alabama, Montana, Louisiana, Alaska, Idaho all in the top 10. Funny to me that the people who hate government assistance the most rely on it the most.
