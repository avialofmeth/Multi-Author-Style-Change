No one ever has said they'll abolish it( some articles already claiming it's abolished). And trust me it's a lie when they will. What really have been said that "گشت ارشاد"(literal translation: guidance patrol) will be abolished by someone who isn't even responsible for it. Guidance patrol is basically a police unit within the morality police that wanders around the city targetlessly just to find one. This unit is supposedly being abolished.
