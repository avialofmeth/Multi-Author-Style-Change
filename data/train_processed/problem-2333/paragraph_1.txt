New Year's Eve is still the biggest celebration day in Ukraine, as far as I've heard. My family celebrates New Year's and both Christmases, and it's one of the best times of the year. It's a great reason to get together and eat, drink, and celebrate life. Might be different for families who don't like each other as much, though. xD.
