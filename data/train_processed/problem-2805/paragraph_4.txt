What labour says and does in opposition is what it thinks is the best course to get back in, what it does while it's in power is what it really wants to do. I know that's shitty and everyone should just be open but that's the political game. The liberal party would never say they are going to defund Medicare while in opposition but as soon as they get in what do they do, try and defund Medicare.
