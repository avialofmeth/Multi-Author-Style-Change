EDIT: Stumbled across , and from a cursory glance it looks like they spent a lot more time on digging into the things he said vs. the things he did (or claimed to do). Bullet points on the validity of his charity and shadiness on his financial disclosures are on pages 7 and 8, sandwiched in between some quotes of his about how "Biden's going to take your guns" and "Ukraine is a totalitarian regime". Claims about employment and education are taken at face value. Him giving $10 to a right-wing Queens County group takes up as much space as his multiple civil judgements.
