Anti-personnel mines are, especially the ones the Russians are using which are just complete and utter war crimes, however anti-tank mines are very cool indeed when used appropriately. Stick 'em nice and visible on a road, now your enemy has 2 choices, use another road, or stay hours at that one cleaning them up, meanwhile your pre-ranged artillery can hit 'em hard.
