Of all the scumbags in Trump's inner circle during his Presidency, I find Pompeo to be the most repugnant. Total sycophant, nakedly ambitious, and an absolute jerk. Remember when he tried to pull a "gotcha" on Mary Louise Kelly from NPR by asking her to point Ukraine out on a map? The funny thing is I doubt he could have until Trump's phone call with Zelenskyy.
