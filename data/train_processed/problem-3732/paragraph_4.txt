To be clear, I do not like this, this type of income inequality is terrible. I like Bernie Sanders' policy ideas precisely because they would help that rural blue collar worker. But it is absolutely some delicious /r/LeapordsAteMyFace energy when the "social conservatives" who have long allied with Wall Street and the rich have a shocked Pikachu face when Nike and Disney and all these household brands completely leave them in the dust in the pursuit of that capitalist dollar. The same capitalist dollar that decades of conservatives splooged over.
