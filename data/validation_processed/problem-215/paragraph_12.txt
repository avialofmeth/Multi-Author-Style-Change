Anyway, I don’t disagree that Republicans should actually try to make a real deal with Democrats on immigration, it just seems like Republicans have so many competing interests that are at odds with eachother, while Democrats aren’t willing to include anything that fixing problems with the asylum system that doesn’t include making it less restrictive.
