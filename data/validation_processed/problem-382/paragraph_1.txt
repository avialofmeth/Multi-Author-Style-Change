So is voting for a third party. It doesn’t matter if a two-party system is good or bad. It’s just what we HAVE so deal with it and vote for the lesser of two evils. I couldn’t believe the Bernie Sander supporters that didn’t vote for Hillary. In what world was Trump a better choice? Be practical, not idealistic. My daughter will have less civil rights than me because of a Puritan Supreme Court, a scary future with a powerless EPA and ridiculous amount of student debt. The conservatives won’t go down without a fight. There is no compromise for them. I wish liberals and moderates would stop bickering and put them back under the racist hateful greedy rocks that they slithered out from.
