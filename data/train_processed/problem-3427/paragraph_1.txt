The point is that varying levels of margins are an inherent part of different industries, regardless of how well run the business is. And it’s easy to say “Well, you shouldn’t do the crime” and sure, they shouldn’t, but then you’ve effectively formulated a system where some industries have an easier time shouldering fines than others. You’ll have low margin industries where any fine at all is effectively just shutting down the business and high margin industries where the fine barely matters, both for the same violations.
