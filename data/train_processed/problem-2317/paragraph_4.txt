Would happen to have a source for that? I'm not trying to be antagonistic, just curious. I've been in some of the countries China has invested heavily in (e.g. Djibouti) and they had a significant presence there. What I've read online as well has shown me that they are making steady economic ties to many African countries with their Belt and Road initiative.
