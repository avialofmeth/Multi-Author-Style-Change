In the netherlands it's compounded by absurd workloads being increased over and over with the years. That comes as an effect of the government refusing to spend more on health care and letting health insurers run wild. This in turn makes people not want to bear the responsibility which makes less people pursue the career and makes more people take a freelance approach which eventually decreases quality of care. It's a downward spiral that's not gonna stop by itself. Truly sad to see.
