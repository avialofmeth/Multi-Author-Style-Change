I personally don't hate him but if I were to look back on his legacy, it is tarnished with the kind of legislative efforts that creep me out and that would infuriate me if I were any older. As is, I am merely concerned and bemused by the fact that most crises we're dealing with are consequences of his actions and that of his ilk, not that he'll ever personally suffer them.
