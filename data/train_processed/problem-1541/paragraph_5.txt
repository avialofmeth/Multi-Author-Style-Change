And I still wouldn’t bother to care because I don’t waste my time on getting worked up about what religion strangers believe in. I’m not the thought police. So long as it stays in their head, it’s their right to think whatever they want to think; including things that I fundamentally disagree with. People who get worked up about religious people getting worked up are exactly the same as the people they’re mad at. It’s ridiculous how aggravated everyone gets over something like this.
