"Everyone saw what defenders we have. For the last eight years. What our civilians are capable of. How they go to rallies under the occupation and stop enemy tanks with bare hands. What kind of children we have. How they sell drawings, collecting money for the Armed Forces. How a girl with shot legs drives a car for 15 km to take out wounded adults.".
