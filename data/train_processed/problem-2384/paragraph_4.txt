You guys just won’t stop with destroying the Republican Party. You’ll destroy half of what I believe in too. I’m cool with a lot of what democrats want but there’s a lot that I don’t want. Larger federal government isn’t something I want or something we need. Restricting my gun rights isn’t something I believe in. More taxation and larger social programs aren’t what I want or believe in.
