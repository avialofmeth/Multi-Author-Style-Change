But it's not just my mom. I've noticed that many of the Asian communities around here don't even like other Asian communities. For instance, the Thai people here do not like Filipinos, Koreans, or Chinese. Like, they interact with each other and then behind closed doors, talk shit about each other and say not to trust the other Asian groups.
