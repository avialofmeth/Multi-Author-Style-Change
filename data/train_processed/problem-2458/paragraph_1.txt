Funny how justice works swiftly when a poor person commits a misdemeanor, but when a rich person commits multiple crimes against the nation and our institutions (not to mention the numerous financial crimes) it just creeps along slowly until the culprit either dies rich and comfortably of natural causes or, even worse, people just to decide to move on in the name of "unity" and "healing".
