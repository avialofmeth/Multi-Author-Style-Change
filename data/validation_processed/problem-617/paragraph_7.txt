In addition, at the end of the day, Microsoft was still developer friendly enough to allow the development of virtual machine framework for integration of code from other operating systems. So I'd argue they were not trying to cut out third-party developers and, in fact, made their OS so third-party friendly that competitors in the industry were able to secure specialization in many other markets. They get knocked for things like forcing internet explorer to be installed, but whether it's an excuse or not - from my understanding they had not properly compartmentalized some of the network functions of IE (the OS required IE to work).
