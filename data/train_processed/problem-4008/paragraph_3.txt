Also the fact that Russians are making those claims does not in anyway give credibility to them. In fact, i'd be even more skeptical of them because it's coming from the Russians. What is more likely happening is that Ukrainians have managed creep towards the edge of the town in the forest, and may be probing the defenses of Kreminna, but those "attacks" are unlikely to have intention of starting a fight inside the town itself.
