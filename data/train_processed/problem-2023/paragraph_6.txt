They moved our job overseas not just for excess profits,but for reduced safety standards,no pensions and no benefits. In many cases alot of these countries use slave labour. By moving good paying jobs away they drove down wages, so people had to start shopping at the worse of places like mal-wart. I was a victim of these polices as I lost a good paying job I had for 25 years, it was moved to China.
