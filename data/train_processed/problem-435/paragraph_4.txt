"Subpoena" means "under penalty" in Latin and is used to reference a court's ability to compel people to provide information or evidence deemed relevant to an ongoing trial or investigation. The courts can demand such information or evidence from anyone, even those that aren't necessarily under investigation themselves. All the court needs is to have a reasonable belief the person has the information in question.
