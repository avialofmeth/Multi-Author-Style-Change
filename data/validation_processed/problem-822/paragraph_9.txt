So when a company like Disney says they oppose Florida's Don't Say Gay law, it's not because they actually care, it's because their consumers are pressuring them into saying that. Same for when they make the decision to cast a Black woman as The Little Mermaid. Right wingers see these things and think Disney is too "woke", but they're just reacting to the general public. Disney used to make incredibly racist stuff when that's what the public wanted.
