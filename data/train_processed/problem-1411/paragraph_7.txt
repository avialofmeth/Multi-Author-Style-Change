The problem is that many trans people aren't straight. IE, there are some people who were born "male" and are attracted to women but transition into lesbians and some people who were born "female" and are attracted to men and transition into gay guys. (And obviously trans people can belong to any of the rest of the spectrum of bi, pan, ace etc). Part of why trans people joined the greater LGBTQ community is because there's such a big overlap of trans people who are also L/G/B/Q.
