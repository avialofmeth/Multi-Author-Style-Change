When we got the repaired computer back a couple weeks later they also gave us a copy of the old hard drive on an external HDD. They didn't give us back any of the original parts. I wanted the original HDD to try and recover the files, cloning a corrupted hard drive simply makes a corrupt copy. And that's what they gave us, a clone of a corrupted drive.
