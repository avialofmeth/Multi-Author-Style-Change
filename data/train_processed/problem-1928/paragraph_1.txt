Again, this does not mean that Russia was the sole cause of Brexit. Rather, because Brexit aligned with Russia’s strategy — at a time when Tories and Boris had unsupervised meetings with oligarchs, and when Russia had been caught funding rightwing political programs in the US, Italy, Germany, and elsewhere — I find it ridiculous to suggest that they had no part in pushing it forward, though only time will tell. Russia didn’t create the Tea Party in the US, for a similar example, but instead funded the most insane members of this crowd through PAC’s, capitalizing on existing, grassroots sentiments and helping them overtake the mainstream GOP platform. That was a decisive Russian victory, without really even requiring direct cooperation or even knowledge on behalf of most of said sponsored candidates.
