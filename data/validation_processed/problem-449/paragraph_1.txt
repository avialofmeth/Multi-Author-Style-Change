You are so presumptuous, you think an average person today reflects on supply chain issues? If Americans were paying attention to a single thing they wouldn’t be stressing today because they’d ne prepared. The Fed told us in 2019 that inflation was coming, they told us what they were going to do, economists told us what that would translate into - and people did nothing. I was laughing my ass off when I read yesterday that JP Morgan is putting a billion dollars into rental homes,I was like why the fuck didn’t you think of doing that in 2019 when the series of events I just spelled out was laid in front of you. People can’t see past their nose.
