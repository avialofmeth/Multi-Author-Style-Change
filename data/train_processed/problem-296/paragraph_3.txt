Personally, I think Politico is one of the worst offenders in the mainstream for whataboutism and bothsiderisms as a soft supporter of Republicans. They were airing a bunch of the now-discredited red wave bullshit before the midterms that were largely fueled by Republican-leaning and even GOPer push-polled polling. Do you see them, or CNN, or any other supposed middle of the road media dissecting their abject failings?
