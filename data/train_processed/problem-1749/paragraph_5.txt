We have a large country with a small population so public transportation is not good, there are so many places even in the city that you can’t even catch a bus. A monthly transit pass in Edmonton is $100. I live in a suburb of Edmonton you can get a bus into Edmonton from one area of my town a few times a day but it’s not practical and costly.
