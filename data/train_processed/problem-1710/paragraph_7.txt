This is just silly. The Brits while around tried between ww1 to ww2 but were unwelcome and revolted against. So on the 1 hand accusing them of colonisation then blame them because they left? (While installing new governments and supporting them) It's a lose/lose situation. Sure it resulted in chaos but i don't see any other possible scenario where it wouldn't have considering the elements involved at the time.
