Unfortunately, due to us not being like the CCP, we can't go kicking in doors and shoving people into unmarked vans whenever we feel like it, need to build a case and pass it to the courts for a warrent and what not. That being said, they can make life difficult for them via these disruptions while they build said case so that it inhibits their operations, kinda the best we got until all is ready to go.
