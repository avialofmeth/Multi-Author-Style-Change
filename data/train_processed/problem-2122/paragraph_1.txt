It really isn't. Hazaras, Tajiks and other smaller groups are always in friction with the various Pashtun tribes, who form the powerbase of the Talis. Obviously it's not that black and white and there is a spillover between the camps but that's the basis of it. Tribal elders in the rural villages rule their tiny fiefdoms and they're also in friction with the urban areas who they tend to view as westernized and Haram. The urban areas tend to view the rural areas as backwards. Afghan in 125 or less words.
