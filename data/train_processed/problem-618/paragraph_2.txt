Don’t have any personal recommendations for Tokyo, but if you get an opportunity to add a visit to Kyoto to your trip I’d highly recommend going to see the Fushimi Inari shinto shrine. There’s a beautiful shrine site at the bottom of the mountain and if you choose you can walk a long path to the summit that will take you through some gorgeous woods with a bunch of little cemeteries and lookouts along the way. It will take some energy and an afternoon but it’s a really peaceful and scenic walk. You can take the Shinkansen there from Tokyo in a couple hours and Nintendo HQ is nearby right off the train path too, so you can make a cool day trip out of those two.
