The idea of them is less as a kill or harm tactic but area denial and in that they are extremely useful. Terrible weapons, but honestly if you are being invaded and that will buy you time, it makes sense. If it's likely you won't win and the other side will lose people for generations to them it makes more sense. War is hell, you do what you can to survive.
