Nope, cold war started few years after WW2. During WW2 Russia was US ally, but then US turned on it because of allege threats of Communism. India just got independence and because of UK US was reluctant to support India. Meanwhile China as huge nation by size and also Nixon wanted Chinaâ€™s help in Vietnam, US wanted their support so it used Pakistan to open those dialogues which is when US and UK started providing military aid to Pakistan against India. In fact in 1971 indo-china war US had its fleet in bay of bengal against India but USSR stopped China from other border and ultimately US had to back down. So whether Ned Price used those exact words or not is irrelevant. US made wrong decisions and failed, and now look to India for help against the monster they created.
