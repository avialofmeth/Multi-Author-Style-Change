I was just drawn into her district with the last census (previously was part of Ted Lieu's) but have lived around this area for 20 years; while there's always been a bit of a conservative streak in the area, it's much less an ideological one, and more a "I've got money and I want to keep it, and I want my quiet little town to stay a quiet little town" conservative.
