I don't say this to be dismissive about the death - imagine a world where Mexicans could safely travel through Mexico and into the US in a way that could verify their identity, verify their employment status, and ensure their wages are not stolen. Mexico would be a safer place, America would be a richer place, and people wouldn't risk their lives like this. Right now the situation is so bad they'd risk dying like this.
