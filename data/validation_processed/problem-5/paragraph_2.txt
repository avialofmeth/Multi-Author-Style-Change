They can’t use another terminal because of customs. And they can’t move customs temporarily. At best they could have diverted to LAX when they received the NOTEM or another international airport enroute, but it would have grounded the plane until JFK terminal 1 reopened and the flight crew had their minimum rest. Then the plane would have to be repositioned either in JFK before it could fly passengers again which would involve flying an empty plane for 6 hours. It’s a pain for everyone, but from a logistics standpoint, it makes sense why they turned around.
