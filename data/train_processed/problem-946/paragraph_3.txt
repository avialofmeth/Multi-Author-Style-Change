Rant: My life went to shit and I'm struggling. Single dad that can't find decent mechanic work or work at all that allows me to provide properly because no one will compromise with me on hours that I need to take care of my autistic son. Barely scraping by doing delivery app jobs. Daycare costs me $800 a month on top of my $600 mortgage +food for us, and bills. a broken windows from vandalism, my heat doesn't work, I'm starving myself on ramen so my kid can eat right and I just don't know how much longer I can take.
