It's the job of the Supreme Court to interpret that constitution. They're like preachers trying to present their own interpretations of the Bible; free to decide what any ambiguities mean. They're not required to use the same interpretations as Thomas Jefferson did. It's an immense amount of power with lifetime appointments and it's been stacked by Donald Trump. This country is in deep shit.
