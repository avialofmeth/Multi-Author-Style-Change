During the long meeting with the Russian Human Rights Council, Putin discussed the mobilization of 300,000 reservists that he ordered in September to beef up troops fighting in Ukraine. Putin said that so far only about 150,000 of them have been deployed to combat zones and the rest were still undergoing training elsewhere.
