“Imagine your brain is like a ski resort. There’s all different levels of slopes but most neurons do the same runs everyday, so neurons don’t carve trails through the backcountry or under the tree runs. When you take a hallucinogenic, it’s like fresh powder on the mountain. The neurons can’t see the trail as clearly, so they feel confident to run a new trail and explore the possibilities. These new trails can link up with old forgotten trails and help other neurons travel down the mountain.”.
