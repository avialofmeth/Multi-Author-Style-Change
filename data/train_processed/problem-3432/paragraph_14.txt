All that said, nuclear war still wouldn’t be the end of the world. According to publicly available nuclear treaty info, there really aren’t any more city buster sized warheads left. Most nukes are 800kt or smaller now, and intended for tactical and not strategic use. What’s more, in the 90’s nuclear strategy evolved away from targeting population centers and is focused on military strategic targets (read; ports, airports, mil bases, resources).
