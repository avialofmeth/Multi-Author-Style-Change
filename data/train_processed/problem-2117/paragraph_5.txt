The incident started when Greene confronted Boebert over her reticence to support Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid for the gavel. “You were OK taking millions of dollars from McCarthy, but you refuse to vote for him for Speaker, Lauren?” Greene asked Boebert in a ladies restroom in the Capitol, according to a source that spoke with The Daily Beast. (Another source revealed that Boebert was unaware Greene was in a stall ahead of the interaction.).
