Human waste has been a traditional source of fertilizer for quite a long time. We produce plenty. Top heavy expansions are fine; we can build up not wide.

Killing people is beyond inhumane once you know the capabilities of people. A defeatist attitude is beyond unbecoming and ventures into the grotesque.
