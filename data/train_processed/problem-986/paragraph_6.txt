It also creates a fun loophole, wherein any trans or otherwise gender-nonconforming children could deliberately lie to the teacher about their preferred pronouns to force the teacher to use something else. Eg, Joe, a trans boy, could express a preference for she/her, and this law would then prohibit the teacher from using those pronouns to refer to Joe. The would then be forced to either just refer to Joe as "Joe," or to use "he/him" (Joe's true preference), or they/them, etc.
