For me this is a bit more nuanced. While I don't shed tears for invading soldiers of any sort, they're all (war) criminals - better the invaders lose a bunch of people than the invaded - I think it's still a tragedy that humans have to be slaughtered for some madmen's ambitions. No matter how terrible the soldiers behave or how bad their choices are, they're still human beings, they shouldn't even be in that situation and their lives shouldn't be wasted for no good reason. And we - lucky enough to not even be faced such situations - shouldn't cheer for their death. But then again, I live in a country that thinks death penalty is barbaric and convicts war criminals.
