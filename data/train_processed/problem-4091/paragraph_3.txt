It might work, but the fact that oil production is not completely monopolized by russia is a way out - the US has massive shale and tar sand projects, and if the price of oil rises a bit more, it'd be profitable to restart them. Not to mention that venezuela still have oil that has not been properly exploited due to their economic and political issues.
