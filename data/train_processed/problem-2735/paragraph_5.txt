On a personal note, (and no one else needs to agree with me) I think there needs to be something even more antagonistic than an unbiased public inquiry. In between Aga Khan, His treatment of Wilson-Raybould, Kleinburgers, CCP police stations, The many instances of Chinese agents being outed, the guy clearly has no morals and works almost purely in self interest or the interest of the Liberal Party, not in the interest of Canada, Canadians and our future.
