Man, it's true though... if only we were living in the Back to the Future part 2 future. Hover everything. Projecting crude 3D holograms. Ronald Regan/Max Headroom style robot waiters at your local 1950's style diners. Your boss being able to big head you in your off hours, monitoring your phone lines, and then to send a fax to your multiple machines that you're fire. Zemeckis you gave me these wants for my future, I demand them over not fixing our crumbling infrastructure. /s.
