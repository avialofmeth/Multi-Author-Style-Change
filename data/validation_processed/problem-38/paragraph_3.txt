I poke my head into right-wing areas every so often to keep a bead on things, and this is honestly the closest to an anti-Trump consensus I've seen among right-wing people since 2015. Actually, Trump basically didn't exist as a political leader for them at all prior to 2015, so I think ... since his rise to power, really, I've never seen so many of them turn on him.
