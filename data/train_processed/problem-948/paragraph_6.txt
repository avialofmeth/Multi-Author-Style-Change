Having small meaningless go-it-alone items like that are just vanity project and lack the economies of scale needed for complex modern military equipment. You need the scale that China, the US, or the whole of Europe signed up before even starting a program. Going it alone and then trying to sell a system like a jet, is just pure program management incompetence in the name of vanity; ie perfectly French.
