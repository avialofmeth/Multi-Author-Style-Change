Where does that number come from? I read the article and I don’t see a source, and at one point it mentions there are “22 cases being legally pursued” and “there are 40 more that are too old to be prosecuted…” wildly inconsistent with the headline claim. Pretty much it just says in the first few sentences that there were 330000 victims in a “recent report” and that information isn’t backed up in any way for the rest of the article.
