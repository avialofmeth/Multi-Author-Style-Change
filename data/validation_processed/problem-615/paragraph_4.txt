I called it not long after 1/6 saying the fix was in for Trump and those in Congress participated in the coup; they should all have been charged immediately and weren't. When I worked as an investigator and we had a serious case with urgency behind it we worked it nearly 24/7... But with Garland weeks turned into months, and months into years. I suspect Smith is only there to clean up the mess and loose ends - it's nearly too late to indict Trump anyway, as we're approaching the 2024 election rapidly, and soon that case will time out because of it's political implications... But then again WTF do I know - maybe Garland will figure out where his balls dropped off and decide to put them back on for a day or two.
