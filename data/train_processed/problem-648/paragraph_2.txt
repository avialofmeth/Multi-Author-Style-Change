uh, apparently toilets are not that intuitive to use. I knew a lady who was in Saigon when the Americans left. She had a NVA officer and a private quartered in her apartment with her. A pecking order was established. The toilet was for the officer. He forbade the private to use his personal face washing basin. See, you pull this little handle and you get new clean water.
