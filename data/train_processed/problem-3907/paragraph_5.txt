Anyways, I'm so glad this therapy works. I can't imagine the lives that will be changed from this discovery. Not just for the kids, but also for their families. This science is bonkers. I'm so relieved to know there are scientists out there looking out for those of us with rare diseases. Humanity's ability to empathize with one another is our greatest strenh.
