Gun makers have cleaned up. Since the AW Ban lapsed in 2004 an additional 22 million AR's have been added to what is on US streets. There were roughly 400K on the streets at the moment the ban ended. And every time a mass shooting occurs, gun sales surge because people foolishly believe congress will add regulations. Of course that never happens. The cycle then repeats after the next shooting. Like nearly ALL issues in America, follow the money.
