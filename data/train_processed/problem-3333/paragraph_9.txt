Yeah I find it odd that anyone who is not a billionaire wants an overpopulated world. Why would anyone want to live in such overcrowded conditions? Looking at the cramped conditions in India and China is depressing. The fact that the world has skyrocketed from 2 billion humans to 8 billion in under 100 years is alarming. The increased competition for resources, housing, work, medical care, energy, food, water… those conditions only benefit the wealthy industry billionaires (the elite “owner” class) at the top who want tons of cheap human labor and consumerism. The pro-natalist people are either obtuse or not in earnest.
