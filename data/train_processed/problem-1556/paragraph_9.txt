I was not aware people had already debunked this. Thanks for the links. I am not sure the phrase "goat fuck" means it is the same source. It is not common but I have heard it a number of times from several different people in the military. To me that indicates the sources might have military ties, but it it is not unique enough to conclude they are the same person.
