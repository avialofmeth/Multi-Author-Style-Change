Five Eyes (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) is arguably a tighter alliance than NATO. NATO the US has to wine and dine to get what it wants, FVEY the US says "we're going this way" and the rest of us tip that hat and say "yes guvnah I'll bring the gun". If NATO is the western whities group chat, FVEY is the sub-group-chat of western whities who speak English.
