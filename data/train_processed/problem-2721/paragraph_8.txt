I can't thank the internet enough. Getting to know from someone right there is just amazing. I am hoping you are living somewhere outside Saudi for your safety, I am sure the internets are completely monitored in most Authoritarian locations. Heard, India has started doing it too. China and Russia already have it to the point then can filter out a word.
