The single best advice i gave my relatives was to go watch some of that spiderman shit that was promoted on youtube kids. 6/6 families started to heavily regulate what their kids can watch and limited the amount of time they can spend on their phone. Worked like a charm. And will do the same with my girl. My dad did the same to me with games years ago. Shit is not hard, someone just has to show them the worst things first.
