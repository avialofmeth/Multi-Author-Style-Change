Also, one of the main reasons why the Swiss haven't been invaded is because of their country's mountainous topography, not just neutrality. With high tech missiles, drones and jets those mountains don't matter as much as they use to. They still do matter but just no where near as much. It's not like the Swiss will be invaded in modern times though.
