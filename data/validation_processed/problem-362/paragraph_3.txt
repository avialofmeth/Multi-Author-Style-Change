i always wondered about just how much collateral damage is wrought by this entire iron dome concept of missile defense . you have a missile incoming , let's launch another one over our own territory to intercept it . i suppose a hit just rains debris over a large area alleviating a gigantic blast but a miss just doubles the effectiveness of the initial launch . so is war ?
