The other thing to consider regarding this is that in order to withdraw from Kherson, it had to be run up the chain of command—Surovikin to the General Staff, General Staff to Gerasimov, Gerasimov to Shoigu, and ultimately to Putin who apparently consulted back with the General Staff. He gave permission after was convinced that they could start regaining territory, if and only if withdrew from Kherson. They now have to deliver—they got to show a win, that the withdrawal was worth it, by having victories somewhere—anywhere—even if it’s stealing credit from Wagner.
