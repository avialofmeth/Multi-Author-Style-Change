In all of the hubbub about gerrymandering, which is a problem for a number of reasons, it seems to be forgotten that Democrats were the ones who came of the redistricting in better shape with analysts estimating a net gain of 6 D-leaning seats, with no net gains or losses for Republicans. In addition, the efficiency gap was all but eliminated, likely reducing the phenomenon of Republicans winning larger majorities when they win (they would largely get proportional minorities when they lost).
