Sounds more like the Russians are colonizing and a few smart ones used the opportunity to leave. The bureaucracy is in shambles and likely won't recover. They can more easily hide assets as a Ukrainian. By design for folks who want to stay as well. Russia wants rich Russians to rebuild ukraine and get richer doing it.
