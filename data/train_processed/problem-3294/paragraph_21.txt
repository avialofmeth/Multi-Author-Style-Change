What’s the end goal here? Are you gonna just sanction sovereign countries every time they do something you don’t like? India is a developing country trying to make money after the train wreck that was and is covid. The last thing anybody needs in the west or asia is an angry India with 1 billion people behind it. That’s before you even consider that they are very instrumental to certain products and services that go to the west. Do you have a replacement for those services and products? This is incredibly short sighted when you consider india could be a potential counter weight to other countries in asia that are 100% not friendly to the west.
