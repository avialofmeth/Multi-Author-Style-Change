There are ongoing major conflicts in Lybia, Ethiopia and Congo. Which for the most part the west has ignored. At the same time you have Western nations ( the very same colonial powers) showing up and shouting "if you don't support Ukraine your arn't for human rights and democracy". At the same time documents are coming out that the Dutch and French assassinated beloved leaders like Lumumba because they could have actually developed their nations.
