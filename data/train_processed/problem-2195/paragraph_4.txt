Interestingly, at least for Presidential elections, the states don't actually have to have an election. They can just pick electors through the legislature. BUT, if they have an election, they have to abide by the results. SCOTUS actually decided that in Bush v Gore, and it was in the part of the decision that didn't limit itself to just that instance.
