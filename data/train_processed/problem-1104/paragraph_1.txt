It's a leaked Kremlin poll, which means it isn't actually a leak and it isn't actually a poll. It's the Kremlin testing the waters to see how people feel about the possibility of negotiating a settlement. Throw it out there like it's a leaked poll with middling support and see how people feel about it. If there's backlash against it (eg - "we should find who these traitors are and put them in prison"), then the government knows not to consider negotiating a settlement. If there isn't backlash (since few people would outright voice support for it since doing so is a criminal offense), then the government knows that it can consider negotiating a settlement because the populace won't reject it or rebel against it.
