But, with MS, I don't have faith that this is to help them increase the quality of their titles or studios. I wouldn't doubt a good number of studios get shut down after the merger. COD is one piece of a bigger puzzle for them, but I feel it's not the most important. Everyone knows they'll find a way to make it exclusive to Xbox and PC(via GamePass/Live), but they want the massive amount of crap content that makes Acti/Blizz popular among the mainstream to support their GamePass initiative, which is there simply to dominate the market.
