If Putin had two brain cells to rub together he might still be able to negotiate stuff like a short term lease of Sevastopol (maybe 10 years) and/or have Crimea returned to Ukraine but as a special autonomous region that would allow Russia's to visit/live/work without a Ukrainian visa (but still Ukrainian laws and jurisdiction).
