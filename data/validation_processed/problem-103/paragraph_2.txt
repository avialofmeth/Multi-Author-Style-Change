Viruses need to evolve alongside its hosts so as to keep being able to infect them through the long cycles of natural change and selection. We have a 50000 years a head start on these specific little beasties, so weâ€™ll be fine. This is why new and contemporary viruses like COVID-19 are far more of a threat to us, by the way. They are the kinds that have mutated in ways that can afflict modern humanity and not our stone age hunter-gathering ancestors or our neanderthal cousins.
