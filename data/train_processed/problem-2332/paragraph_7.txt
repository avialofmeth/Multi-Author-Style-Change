I am not just calling myself a republican, I am one. I have worked in republican politics my entire adult career. Having been a campaign staffer for some pretty big names, worked in Statehouses and the US Senate for some other big names... I believe in the ideology of the republican party, I believe in our solutions and I support moderate republicans in leadership positions.
