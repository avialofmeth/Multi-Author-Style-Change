The only positive for Iran on this is that their airspace is now more difficult to operate in. That’s it. The Su-35 is a 4.5 gen aircraft. An F-22 or an F-35 would fire the first shot before the Su-35 even knew it was there. Additionally, the high maneuverability of the Su-35 comes at a cost. It’s is extremely visible! So a modern AA system would be a major headache for this aircraft. Is it better than what iran has now? Sure. That’s it though.
