Despite expectations of a “red wave”, Democrats absolutely killed it in state legislature elections. Democrats flipped both the Michigan House and Senate, winning a trifecta for the first time in four decades. They also flipped the Minnesota Senate, winning a trifecta there as well. And now they will most likely flip the Pennsylvania House from Republicans (they didn’t win the PA Senate because the most competitive elections weren’t up for election this year unfortunately). There’s even a chance that Democrats may even flip either chambers of the Arizona legislature, which would be a huge deal if Republicans try to overturn the election again in 2024.
