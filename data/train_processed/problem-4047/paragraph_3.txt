Today there were more explosions in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts, apparently, we targeted their military bases again. Russians reported that everything was intercepted as usual, but there are videos showing big explosions happen on the ground, so something was definitely hit. Actually, those missile strikes that were aimed at Kharkiv might have been a retaliation for hitting their military bases, but unsurprisingly they are retaliating against civilians every time their military targets get hit.
