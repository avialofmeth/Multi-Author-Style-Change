But I already got an idea of grooming her to become SCOTUS Justice to replace Thomas. Something like an antidote of Thomas and Barrett put together. I hope that she becomes Circuit judge in few years to have the necessary experience. She could be younger than either Barrett or Thomas when nominated and still have more relevant experience than both put together!
