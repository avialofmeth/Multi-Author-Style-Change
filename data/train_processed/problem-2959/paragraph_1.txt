It took a long while for Elon Musk's reputation to be ruined. It took years and years of being a billionaire asshole to do so. All the while until recently, he had millions of millions of fans, who thought he was a superior person because he had some sort of superior abilities, when in fact, he is just another born rich, sick in the head, anti-social billionaire living in his own King on Earth will all the toys, whores and millions of employees, who merely owns people because he has enough money not to even notice. These people are not heroes, they are sick.
