I once spent a week in the UK and most of their food sucks. Just terrible rubbish. Indian food was pretty good there. And bangers and mash are alright if the gravy is good. Their breakfast is good too but if you let yourself eat the beans for breakfast you'll be farting all day. The rest of their food sucks tho. Very bland and basic. And if britishers hate American food so much why do you have so many fucking McDonalds and burger kings and kfc's? And all those places were jumping and the local restaurants I went to we were the only people there.
