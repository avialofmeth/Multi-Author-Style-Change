Some ancient Egyptian mummies were preserved almost like they were still alive, by basically isolating them from any amount of water/air/etc (by encasing them in many layers of coal and other materials). They were still so "fresh" that the tissues were still supple and lifelike 3000+ years later. That would probably be the least painful way to bury someone in this scenario.
