Can we all just stop a beat and acknowledge how fcking surreal all of this is? One of our two major political parties is outright and openly targeting innocent groups of American citizens. And the only thing anyone is doing about it is reminding each other to vote. Obviously of course vote but we worry too much about the possible future and lose sight of how really bad things already are. Vote and cross your fingers is an abnormal under-reaction and should be unacceptable to still be relying on. We need to be demanding more from everyone with any modicum of power.
