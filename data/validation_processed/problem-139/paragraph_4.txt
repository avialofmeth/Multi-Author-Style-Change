The GOP Senate Majority Leader in my State House got busted about two years ago driving drunk in the middle of the night the wrong way down an interstate at excessive speeds. He even tried to outrun the police. When he was finally pulled over he was extremely belligerent and verbally abused the arresting officer, but was released almost immediately on his own recognizance upon being taken into jail.
