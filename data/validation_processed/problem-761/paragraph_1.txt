Thatâ€™s not true. The German army was basically stripped to the bone. The German Air Force was prohibited from having planes and the German Navy was confiscated. Parts of western Germany were occupied by the French and British and war reparations levied as part of the Versailles Treaty were ruinous to the German economy. The Germans knew that they lost the war but the emerging far right in the 1920s and 30s blamed communists and Jews on the home front for stabbing the German Army in the back and losing the war. It was all bullshit because the German Army was crumbling during the Hundred-Days Offensive and would have completely collapsed had the war not ended on 11 Nov 1918.
