You can live with cancer for many many years before anything happens, and it can happen very quickly. My grandfather lived with prostate cancer for 30 years totally fine before all of a sudden things took a downturn. Like one week he was walking around normally doing normal things, the next week he was in a hospital bed for 4 months before he died. He had actually run a marathon not long before that. It was totally out of the blue.
