Anyone can look up the North Atlantic treaty online, all article 5 says is that the countries agree that an attack against one is an attack against all, and if a NATO country is “attacked”, all NATO countries will “assist” the attacked country in what they deem to be the “appropriate” way to “restore and maintain security”. It’s intentionally open to interpretation based on the individual situation. But in this situation, let’s not be fucking naive, NATO is a defensive alliance against Russia and invoking article 5 in response to this means punitive military operations against Russia to which all NATO members will be obligated to contribute.
