Rheinmetall just bought Expal, one of Europe's largest producer of all kinds of ammunition, for $1.24 billion. They're also building a new ammunition plant in Germany that will by June deliver 300,000 FAPDS Gepard rounds worth approx. $300 million to resupply the Gepards operating in Ukraine. If they can produce that many of the rather complicated FAPDS shells in half a year, I don't see why they should not be able to build a second production line for 130mm tank ammo there as well. They'd certainly have access to all manner of components and propellants now that they own Expal.
