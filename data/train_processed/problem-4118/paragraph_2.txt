If it were not for immigrants our economy would be in the toilet now. They literally keep the wheels turning. Ukrainians are some of the hardest working people you can find. Politicians talk tough about the border but they never do anything since they know their corporate sponsors need the cheap labor to keep the doors open. That's where we need unions so they are not abused.
