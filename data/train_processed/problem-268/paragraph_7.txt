He came to Dallas after they had won their division w legendary Tony Dorsett as their star RB. Immediately team got worse. Herschel had a monster statistical year when they were terrible w just 3 wins getting the iconic Tom Landry fired. He was on their awful 1-15 team w Jimmy Johnson, famously was the trade bait that launched the dynasty, replaced by Emmitt Smith another legend. Then he had some OK years but mostly as an all purpose back who could run back kicks, not the franchise workhorse he should have been coming out of college.
