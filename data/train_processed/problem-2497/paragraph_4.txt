I only recently found out about clerk.house.gov, but it's ridiculously powerful. You can see exactly who voted for what in a very clear format with filters that let you drill down into who from where did what, and you can go directly to a representative's page and see everything they've voted on and what they voted, so you can figure out if your representative is accurately representing what you want to happen in government.
