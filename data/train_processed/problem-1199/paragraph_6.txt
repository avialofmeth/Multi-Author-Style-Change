In many cases, the Wal-Martization of America made it the only company within distance in a lot of areas. Persuant to Wager's comment, a megastore with a garden dept, mensware, sporting goods, etc, is going to push out any smaller competitors in those fields because the big store doesn't need to specialize, and can afford to take losses in areas to capture the market. Mom&Pops can't.
