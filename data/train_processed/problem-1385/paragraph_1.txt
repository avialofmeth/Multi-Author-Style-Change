Edit: to clarify there is no misdirected hate here. I live in a country with a very expensive public medical system that mostly pays for end of life care (up to 90 percent of total spend) and otherwise offers limited access for everyone else. It's by some fucked design or lapse thereof. Meanwhile my sick wife needs to wait 6-18 weeks to speak to someone who's gonna be rude and not helpful for several essential healthcare needs.
