If you want to really feel horrible about the whole thing go look up the texts from discovery about his talks in acquiring Twitter, and what the people around him were proposing. At this point, Musk is all on this maniacal frenzy, like the fact that he wants to just throw out the internet and make his all in one "X" app for everything is pretty scary, even moreso that he keeps throwing "blockchain" around as some magical technology for everything. Musk is full on "libertarian" at this point, funny how the people that control vast amounts of money and power trend towards heavy deregulation and attacking marginalized people.
