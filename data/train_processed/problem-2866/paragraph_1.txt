Here in Washinon State it's colder than usual for this time of year. We usually don't have snow that sticks, until around Thanksgiving. We've had several inches on the ground for over a week now. The planets has been screwed up and it's going to get worse. Politicians just keep supporting industry without climate improvement being mandated. The rich will continue to do so, until their factories are affected and their families are dying. To them, it's a problem we can deal with later. The problem is. IT IS LATER!
