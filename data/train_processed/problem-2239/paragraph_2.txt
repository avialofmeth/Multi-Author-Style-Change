No reason why anyone would to listen to me since I’m a nobody, but I’ve thought that crypto was a hustle and a scam from day one. What gave it away, in my mind, was the mad dash of investors, most of them funds or already wealthy individuals, looking greedily to make more. Always more. From something that produced nothing and neither had nor created tangible value. That’s how all Ponzi schemes have worked since Ponzi himself was born.
