I think the message this official was trying to convey is that the crisis isn't necessarily over, because people are still getting sick and hospitalized, but I don't think we can call this a pandemic any longer if the infection rate remains relatively consistent. That's the definition of it being endemic. The two are different phases of virus proliferation and are therefore mutually exclusive.
