        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 uses standard punctuation marks such as periods and commas, while Paragraph 2 includes hyphens and an ellipsis. This difference in punctuation style may indicate a distinction in writing style.",

    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 contains formal and straightforward language suitable for a factual report, while Paragraph 2 includes informal language and misspellings ('ZuZpiciouZly', 'mentaly'). This significant contrast in lexical and grammatical features suggests a different authorship.",

        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 consists of coherent and moderately complex sentences describing specific events. In contrast, Paragraph 2 features an abrupt and disjointed sentence structure with non-standard phrasing. The disparity in sentence structure and coherence supports the likelihood of different authors.",
