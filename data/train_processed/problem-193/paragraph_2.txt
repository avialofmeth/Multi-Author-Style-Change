Life has been preying on other life for almost as long as it has existed. Humans and our close relatives are all omnivorous and some cultures subsist entirely on meat by eating the entire animal. Meat is hugely nutrient-dense, which makes it incredibly valuable for people without easy access to food, and for the rest of us a few servings of meat a week do a lot to boost our nutrient intake.
