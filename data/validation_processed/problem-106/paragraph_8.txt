Youâ€™re literally posting in a politics sub. I have no issues improving the voting process, but we have one side claiming irregularities with zero evidence; that is not good faith criticism, that is sore loserism and a lack of respect for our democratic process. Plus they offer no actual solutions, and the plans they do support actively make voting worse for many people.
