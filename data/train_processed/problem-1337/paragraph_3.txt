Because, while they screamed about the economy & gas prices for a year, they never had any plan that could address those. They do not care about legislating. They do not care about governing. They only care about scaring people to stay in power, and attacking people who are unpopular, because that also helps them stay in power with their bigoted, xenophobic and homophobic base. They are bottom feeders of the same type as George Santos. Their only gripe with him is that his lies are too easy to spot.
