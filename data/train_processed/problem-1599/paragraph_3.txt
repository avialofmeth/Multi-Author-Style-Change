Another facet of it is that "flip-flopper" has become such a big political gotcha that even when a politician is wrong for reasons that aren't their fault (they had the best available information at the time, but it was incomplete), they're punished for it politically. Which is really stupid, because it incentivizes stubborn denial and gaslighting.
