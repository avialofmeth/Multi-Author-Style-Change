Doing the same in UP, first year in power 2017 saw the UP Police kill over a thousand goons in encounters, may sound extreme but the level of support politically connected gangsters got under SP was criminal. Under BJP criminals surrendered begging to not be killed. Such an improvement in the lives of people does not go unrewarded. Exploiting people through low paying jobs and high expenses is way more profitable.
