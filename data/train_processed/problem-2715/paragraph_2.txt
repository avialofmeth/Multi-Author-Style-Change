Brazillian here. We already have , even if these were mostly made meaningless during Bolsonaro's reign. I have no idea why one would create something anew while the know-how already exists and only needs to be given 'roids & enforced. While I'm appreciative of the spirit, Lula will get jaded looks from brazillians who are more austere and voted for him because the alternative was too horrible to consider.
