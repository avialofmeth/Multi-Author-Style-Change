Yeah I don't know nearly enough about other country's healthcare to speak on them, I just know I've had some frustrating experiences in the US. Currently have a $5k bill for a medicine I'm supposed to take every 8 weeks that I haven't paid and haven't been able to refill for months as a result. The medication is $24k before insurance and the rest is usually covered by a copay assistance program but they have an anual limit so the remainder is supposed to be covered by ANOTHER program I had to enroll in through my employer and none of them will pay the 5k.
