I mean im canadian and i could list way more US Presidents than Canadian prime ministers and know a ton more about US history then canadian history just because US History is plastered all over TV much more than any other history and I happen to watch a lot of TV. They are just trying to stop US Influence from doing what it did to me on a grand scale lol.
