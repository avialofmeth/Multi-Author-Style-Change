Seismologists and geologists had been pointing at the Maras fault line for decades, saying it's extremely risky, begging for authorities to take measures before a big earthquake happens. Naci Görür (leading turkish seismologist) was saying in his twitter account that he is worried about a possible earthquake in that fault line just two days before the quakes happened.
