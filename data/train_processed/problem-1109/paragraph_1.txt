I wouldn’t go that far. I suspect it’s a mix of not enough time, not enough transport capacity and, if particularly cynical, the calculation that caring for a wounded man who won’t be returning to combat any time soon is a non-trivial resource drain…but one that’s easily turned into the enemy’s problem.
