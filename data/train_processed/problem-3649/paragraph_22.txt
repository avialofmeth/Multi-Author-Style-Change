There are also thousands of 80s-00s armoured vehicles, aircraft, and munitions that could be transferred from the US to Ukraine for only the cost of shipping and training. The US keeps these in mothballed storage in case the US ever gets invaded (somehow...), and since it costs money to keep them maintained, arguably they would be better used in Ukraine rather than being stored until they reach the ends of their lives and have to be scrapped.
