EDIT: No, Belarus isn't already part of Russia, Lukashenko clearly isn't doing what Putin wants him to. He can't get the Belarusians under control() and he isn't sending soldiers to fight Ukraine. At the moment, Russia has to fix Belarus' problems, while they're not getting much in return. That's why an outright annexation would be a pretty high priority.
