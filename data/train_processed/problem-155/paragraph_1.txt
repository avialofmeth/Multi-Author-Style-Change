The strategy may be to spread the US thin. How many different countries can the US send 20-years-in-Iraq-and-Afganistan worth of billions of dollars in one check to? The reality is Europe is not exactly united and willing in standing up to Russia, and Europe doesnt exactly feel like it has to have any stake in Korea or Taiwan or Iran as the US feels it has to. So if it falls solely on the US to put out all the fires, given the state of affairs domestically, the US will likely fall apart before it can handle all conflicts at once-- and all these countries will get away with whatever they're after.
