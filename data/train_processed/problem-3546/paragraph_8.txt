That wouldn't include training which is the biggest part of a operators value, but using the Value of Life for Russia at $40,000 each soldier at 4 people for a tank is $252,640,000 meaning total lost is $1,277,870,002 but even then you still need to calculate the ammo and equipment of onboard. Since I used the minimum value for everything I would take a guess and say the total value of Russia tank losses would be $2,500,000,000 but this is a guess.
