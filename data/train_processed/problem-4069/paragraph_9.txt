She sticks to sound bytes in debates and that seems to really resonate with their base voters. They need someone smart to really go after her in the debates. There was a lot of missed opportunities there I saw. Biggest one being, she criticized and made fun of Bidens green energy push, and then in her next answer praised having the largest solar energy panel producers in the country in her county. I couldnâ€™t believe he missed the chance to attack her on that.
