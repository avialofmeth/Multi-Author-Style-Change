You are wrong. The bulk of the human diet is fruits, vegetables and grains. Research has found this is what gave the gladiators such strong bones. Meat is not nutrient dense. This is a falsity perpetuated from ignorant traditions. The nutrients from animal flesh come from plants. You can take any fruit or vegetables and see how loaded with vitamins and antioxidants there are. Animal flesh is loaded with mostly things that are bad for you such a concentration of pollutants and saturated fats. Get schooled on the reality of what the standard diet does to people versus those who eat mostly plant based. Most food allergies actually come from eating animal flesh because it starts the chain of inflammation, which then carries over into food allergies from other things.
