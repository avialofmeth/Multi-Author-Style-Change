She was at 34K earlier today (maybe higher, I caught the Pima, Pinal, and Maricopa drops all at once, and if Pima came first that would have put her further ahead before Pinal and Maricopa chipped away). The big drop is always Maricopa which went 55-45 in Lake's favor this time, so it is definitely accurate to say Lake cut into Hobbs's lead.
