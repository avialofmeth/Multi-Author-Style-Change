Technically you are correct. All that happens at the point of zero emissions is that the rate of heating stops accelerating. There is hope when we get methane emissions to net zero. Methane contributes about 50% of the present heating and has a half-life of around 12 so there is a prospect of reducing the rate of heating from that point. Shame we are only targeting 2050 for the turnover point. We should aim for ASAP. Another28 years of accelerating heating and worsening climate impacts will be disastrous.
