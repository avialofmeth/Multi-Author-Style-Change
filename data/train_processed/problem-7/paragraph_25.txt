Execution is only used for extreme cases of murder, rape, or sedition. Almost every execution in Indonesia in the past 20 years has been for drug trafficking (which carries very strict penalties throughout Asia, regardless of religion), with a notable exception being the execution of three involved in the Bali terrorist attack in 2008. No one has been executed for moral or religious violations, ever. Many years have had no executions, and the most ever killed in one year was 14 (all for drug trafficking.).
