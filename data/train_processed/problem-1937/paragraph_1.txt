This is how you get a Ukraine working towards being nuclear armed by any means. Countries like France etc don't seem to understand that this is an existential crisis for Ukraine and they don't intend to ever give Russia the opportunity to do this again. In years to come when Europe has a Ukraine pulling clandestine actions for self preservation some leaders will act all surprised. But the general public won't be.
