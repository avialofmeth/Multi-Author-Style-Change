Saying your votes don't matter is just incorrect. I'm aware the ramifications of the Electoral College, 2 party system, etc. But your vote does help elect a President, Senators, Representative, state representative and/or senator, county board, alderman... If the person you voted for doesn't win, that doesn't mean you didn't have any power.
