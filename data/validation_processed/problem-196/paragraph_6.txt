As for the Camp David Accords, peace with Egypt was inevitable. Egypt wrecked Israel in the 1973 Yom Kipper War, and as much as Israel likes to claim they were winning at the end, they were burning themselves thin. Their southern forces were practically wiped out, where as the Egyptians still had plenty of forces, albeit separated and fighting independently from one another, still making plenty of headway by the time a truce was called.
