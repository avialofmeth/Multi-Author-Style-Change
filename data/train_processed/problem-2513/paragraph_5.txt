For a certain subset of crazies, they need Israel to rebuild the Temple (which also means bulldozing some existing ancient temples like Dome of the Rock...) in order to summon Jesus (despite no one being able to know the time that He would return...) and punish all the evildoers. Who actually counts as an evildoer may surprise some of them, but they can hurt a whole lot of people in the meantime.
