And his "biggest regrets in life" was lying about obtaining a college education? Really? I would think that would be minor compared to lying about your mother dying during the 9/11 attack. Or lying about being Jewish just so you can appeal to Jewish voters. And then later on, he lied about his mother dying of cancer. He basically was just hitting on everything he thought would align himself with voters. But I am sure he will tell us he was just trying to be what is constituents wanted him to be.
