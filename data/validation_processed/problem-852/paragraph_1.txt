You see, as soon as they have enough fissile material it becomes quite easy (for a State, mind you) to make a bomb. Also, bombs are relatively small, so easy to hide. A military nuclear program can only be stopped by military means if it is in the production of fissile material stage, as the Israelis did before with Iraq and Syria. After that it is fait acompli.
