It truly does, it’s so horrible and aggravating. Let alone they purposely tied Ukraine funding into the bill in order to jam it through…which is extremely messed up on multiple levels. So many agencies, departments and organizations need massive audits and there budgets are beyond inflated, because they blow all the money they didn’t spend at the end of the fiscal year so they can get more money. It’s all such a headache….
