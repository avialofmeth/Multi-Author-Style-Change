The definition of "working" here is that russian mobik is valued far lower then a Ukrainian Heroy. Putin doesn't care if 10 untrained gopniks die in order to take out of war a single well trained and equipped soldier with experience and dedication. For russia and russians a single injured Ukrainian is worth his/her weight in gold.
