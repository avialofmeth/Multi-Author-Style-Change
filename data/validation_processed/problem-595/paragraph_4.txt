Jokes aside, even India has been very insistent over the years that their dealings with China should be kept purely bilateral. Neither of them want anyone else (especially America) coming in because both are wary of foreign interference. Seems India might be slightly shifting their stance a bit since quad is a thing, but from what I understand India is still one of the least active members.
