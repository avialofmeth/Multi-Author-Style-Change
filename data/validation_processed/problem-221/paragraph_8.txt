If anything, that window is opening. This decade presents the most favorable naval conditions that China is likely to see in the near future because the US navy is decommissioning ships in the next few years without immediate replacements. At the same time China is rapidly expanding its own navy, scheduled to add another 60 naval ships by 2025 and an additional 40 on top of that by 2030. In that time period the US is retiring 7 of its 17 active Ticonderoga class cruisers and the replacement DDG(X) class is only slated to begin production in 2030, and the design hasn't even been finalized yet. The new Constellation class frigates are going to begin trickling into the navy starting 2026. China just launched their 3rd aircraft carrier this year and is supposed to complete their 4th late this decade, and most importantly for an invasion of Taiwan they are completing a number of amphibious transport vessels to enable them to actually carry over the troops they would need.
