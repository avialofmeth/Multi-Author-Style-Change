This makes a lot of sense. I dated someone who had been abused in a prior relationship, to the point of suicide attempt, and it was unsettling when they'd switch to overly nice and accommodating out of the blue. The most innocuous things could be a trigger. Abuse should be punishable like any major crime. It literally kills the person they were, even if their body is still there.
