I have done plenty research bud, the shah before our previous shah, some argue he was a form of dictator, and I see their point as he essentially outcasted Islam and outcasted the ayotallah to Iraq… not fully taking into consideration that it’s been a Muslim country since 660AD. But his successor reza shah re opened conversations with them as he himself was Muslim (his father wasn’t obv). But he also changed the arrangement with the oil, which the west did not like, and subsequently after a lot of Shenanigans he left Iran and this government took over.
