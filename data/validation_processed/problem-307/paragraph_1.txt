Well it's not WW2 anymore. There is no bank secret anymore, Swiss politicians worked during WW2 with the Nazis together, that's a fact but Switzerland worked with Jews/ Israel after WW2 together to pay back whatever it was, Switzerland wasn't neutral during the cold War, neither during the Balkan war or the annexion of Tibet, Crimea, etc.
