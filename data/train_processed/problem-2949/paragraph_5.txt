I have to keep mentally reminding myself that he hasn’t been removed from office because even a few of these stories should have been more than enough. If he were ousted, this would feel gratuitous at this point, the world’s first 100% true character assassination, like beating a dead horse so long that people start screaming that it’s already dead. But he’s still in office, so no, actually we do need to keep unearthing this stuff.
