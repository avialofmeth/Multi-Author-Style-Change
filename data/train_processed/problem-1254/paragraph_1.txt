Apparently during the winter war between Finland and the USSR the Soviets were notoriously under equipped and poorly supplied. They were basically starving and the Finn’s were very good at preventing the Soviet’s supplies from getting through. They managed at one point to bait and ambush an entire column of Soviets by making a huge kettle of sausage stew, and letting the smell waft downwind where the famished soldiers could pick up the smell. The Russians found what they thought was a Finnish encampment that had been abandoned so quickly the food was still cooking over a fire. Instead of being cautious, or remembering that the Finns were never caught off guard they instead rushed to the stew and started gorging themselves. Guns were dropped, guards were let down and the Finns surrounded the Russians and blasted them all straight to commie hell.
