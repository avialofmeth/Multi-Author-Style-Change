It's schrodinger's brexit. It at any given time you can point at something and say "This is why people voted brexit" or "This isn't why people voted Brexit" and be both right and wrong. Brexit was clusterfuck of made up reasons that don't reflect reality and if something goes wrong people who voted for brexit just shift narrative to "This isn't why we voted brexit, here is other unicorn reason why and if that goes to shit we will shift narrative again".
