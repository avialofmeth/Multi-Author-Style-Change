He sees himself and his fate in the other dictators. He knows what usually happens to dictators when they lose power. That's why he's afraid of democracy and is doing all he can to stop it coming anywhere near the Kremlin. It's why he feared the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. To his paranoid mind it looked like America bringing democracy right to his doorstep. He believed that from there, if he didn't stop it, it could spread into Russia. America signalling support of the protestors just reinforced his fear that America was going to topple him just like other dictators.
