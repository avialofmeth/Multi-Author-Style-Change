Trump got a lot of crazies to vote who previously didn't, and won't if Trump himself isn't on the ballot (we saw it in the midterms, the GA runoff, and here) and the most sycophantic of his devotees think the Democrats have full control over elections so it's not worth it to vote because "the fix is in". Desantis probably won't be able to rile up that far right contingent enough to vote or get out of their conspiracy theories.
