While Musk is becoming increasingly aggressive in regurgitating Russian propaganda, it's also true that many in the media space don't do themselves any favours, either, with how loose they play with accurate representation of facts in the age of "clicks and views above everything else". Journalistic integrity is almost as low as it was at the inception of the profession (i.e. the original tabloid print newspapers). Sensationalized into absurdity clickbait titles & articles reign supreme.
