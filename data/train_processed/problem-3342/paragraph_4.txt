In retrospect, that's how Castro maintained his grip on power and brainwashed so many. Internet access in Cuba and cellphones have been inaccessible until relatively recently. For most of Castro's regime, all Cubans had as a source of information was national TV and word of mouth from outsiders (family in other countries or tourists).
