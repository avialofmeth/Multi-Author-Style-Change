Everyone in this situation is looking to do things together, they do not want to deliver alone. Poland, Finland keep stating that they want to do a joint-delivery of Leopards with partners. Germany is not immune to this, except they do not want to just work with Euro allies, thus far they have insisted on only making a move on this heavier stuff with participation from the US. The US state department responded by saying that they support anything Germany wants to send. This is obviously not what Germany was looking for, but again, this leads to Germany's specific need for US involvement causing the bottleneck.
