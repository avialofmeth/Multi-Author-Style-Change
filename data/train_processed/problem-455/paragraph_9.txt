Madness for a number of reasons. What I would support is laws that are struck down either by state supreme court or SCOTUS to be essentially removed from the books. In that case the Dobbs ruling wouldn't have had such an asinine impact on a few states like Arizona and Wisconsin. (Former has a pre-state, territory law against it and the latter has a pre civil war era rule against it.).
