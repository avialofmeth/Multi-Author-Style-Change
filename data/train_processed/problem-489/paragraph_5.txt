Congress voted for this. Democrats AND Republicans 80 to 15 in the Senate. Yes, Biden will sign it. But the blame goes all around. Most of the blame belongs to the railroad owners. They are the ones putting profit before their workers. They have been making record profit and don't want to give any of it up.
