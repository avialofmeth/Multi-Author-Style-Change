I did some reading about that- as of June the newest aircraft carrier of theirs, Fujian, has barely left port for trials. The newer model carrier that you mentioned, is still to be determined whether it will be nuclear-powered or diesel, and one expert says it’s most likely to be diesel. The Chinese are behind in nuclear-reactor tech for fitting an aircraft carrier and they are unlikely to wield a decent enough reactor without the level of tech and experience the US has had decades to master. These guys have never run a carrier ever before in their history. It’s no surprise their newest one has issues and that they had big plans they need to scale back on for the Type 004.
