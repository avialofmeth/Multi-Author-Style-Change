The fly in the ointment so to speak (and it's a big one) is that the vote is during the legislative session and a LOT of bills have been filed already that seek to restrict cannabis programs in the state anticipating passage. Many bills have effective dates of 2025 <-- that's when rec would, if 820 passed, would be fully implemented and anyone could apply for a sales license (the ballot title indicates only businesses in operation as medical for a year could do this in the first 2 years).
