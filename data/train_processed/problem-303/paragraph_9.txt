Former StUffz here, you are only partly right. Rheinmetall is telling the german Government they need that long. KMW, the main manufacturer of the Leopard, already said that they would need less than a month to get a Brigade Size Force of Leopards ready for transfer. Its a big lobbyism work and deals between Rheinmetall and the German Government. Germany could send around 60-80 tanks for sure, but only if new expensive contracts are signed again in Rheinmetall's Favor. The whole German Defense Apparat is a clusterfuck.
