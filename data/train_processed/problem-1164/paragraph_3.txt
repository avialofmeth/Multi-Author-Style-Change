It was appalling to hear the Nepali worker who said he was forced to work without rest on 52C hot days. The number of fatalities officially reported is 37 - which is laughable & on-your-face lie. And FIFA is worse than IOC when it comes to bribery & corruption..If Kim Jong Un gave the right price I won't be surprised they'll host 2038 FIFA in NK.
