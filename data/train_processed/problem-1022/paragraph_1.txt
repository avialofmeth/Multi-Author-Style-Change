Gaining seats in the senate is a bit historic. In the last 60 years it's only happened a handful of times. In most mid term cycles the party controlling the White Houses lost Congress entirely and lost seats in the Senate as well (50-50 splits are pretty rare during a Presidential election year, normally you only see those splits after seats are lost in the following midterm). If, and it is still a long shot no doubt about it, Dems actually keep the House as well, then that will only be the third time in 42 years, and Carter was President then. That's why people dumped on Trump pretty hard for losing both during his midterm cycle, because it usually doesn't happen that way. Dems losing the House is just par for the course, but Republicans retaking it by only a seat or two? That's unheard of.
