tl;dr Yellowstone wolves have been getting toxoplasmosis as a result of eating the feces of infected mountain lions. This makes them more predisposed towards risky behaviour like leaving their home pack and fighting other wolves for dominance. This makes them more likely to become pack leaders but also more likely to sustain fatal injuries or lead their pack into dangerous situations.
