Now, I love it and I'm much more productive than I was in the office. Meanwhile, I don't have a commute (besides dropping my son off at school and then coming home), can make my lunch fresh, can use my own bathroom instead of the public one at work, can set my own thermostat (my office was always either freezing or boiling), and can work in peace and quiet rather than getting interrupted for meaningless chatter.
