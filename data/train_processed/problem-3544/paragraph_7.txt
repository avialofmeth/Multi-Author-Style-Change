A functional democracy requires separation of power, and what the Netanyahu govt is trying to do is destroy all separation of power. Already separation of power in Israel is weak, with a single election securing control of both legislature and executive wings. Now they want to also do the same to the judiciary, by making it so any rulings it makes are meaningless since parliament can veto it in a single re-vote.
