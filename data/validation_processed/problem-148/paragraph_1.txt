I keep thinking about how Pennsylvania has the highest number of hate groups, despite being one of the smaller states with a smaller population. Right wing fundementalists/the klan/Nazis can't even get along with each other long enough to accomplish something. Because they aren't tryng to do any particular piece of useful work, they are paranoid and angry and only want to tear down the work of others.
