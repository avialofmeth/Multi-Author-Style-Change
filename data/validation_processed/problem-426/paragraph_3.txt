But normal Usenet, that you and I probably grew up with, is very much alive and well. We just probably donâ€™t get access as part of our ISP bill every month. Instead, I pay $5-$9 every few years because buying 1TB for a couple bucks lasts forever unless one is pirating massive amounts of media or something. Just reading and engaging with groups lasts for a really long time.
