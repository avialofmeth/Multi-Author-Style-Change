Yes you can if they are unregistered foreign agents on your soil. You can kill them if you wanted to if they have no diplomatic cover. Spy’s have no protection outside of diplomatic cover. They aren’t uniformed military personnel neither so no Geneva convention protections. Issue is they will arrest and kill random Canadians in China claiming they were non cover agents too.
