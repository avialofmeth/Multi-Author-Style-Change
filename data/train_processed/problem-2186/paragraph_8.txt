They're not. The fact that a majority (Dem or GOP) is this tight doesn't leave any room to maneuver...especially with the reality that the Senate may stay in Dem control. One would think that a slight Dem majority, post-midterms, in the House would mean the status quo like from 2021-now, however the electoral map would loom large in their plans, especially with the upcoming presidential elections sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
