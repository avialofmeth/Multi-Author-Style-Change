The CIA is a shady, shitty, and down right dangerous organization, but if you make these assertions, please back up these claims, I don't even need super hard evidence, just some evidence. Many conspiracy people quote documents to give themselves legitimacy, relying on the fact that most people won't read a 712 page document to verify the information. I actually went through it and from what I saw, "Columbia" isn't even mentioned.
