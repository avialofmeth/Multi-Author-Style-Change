Reminds me of a section from the book Accessory to War, by Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He talks about how as the situation for Germany in WWII grew more bleak, the government leaned harder into astrology for their propaganda as a way to 'forecast' military success. If Russia is afraid of psychic attacks, then they are certainly rhyming with history for military powers that know they're losing.
