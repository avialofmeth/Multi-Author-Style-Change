But this is a 1-year-old baby. It can't talk, can't pick someone out of a lineup, can't testify in court or tell anyone what names it overheard you use or where you've gone; it poses absolutely no threat. There was zero reason for those guys to kill that baby with a bullet in the head outside of actual, murderous hate.
