Picture a Venn diagram with three circles: the rich, the racists, and the religious. Each with different interests around the outside but lots of similarities in the center. All of them hate the government. The rich thought that they could control the racists and the religious. The racists and the religious have now become increasingly mainstream. The path ahead frightens me.
