I think you're not placing the risk correctly. If you're vaccinated with mrna vax any American varients are going to be much more dangerous. Because any new varients in china are not going to evolve to escape mrna vax antibodies. In a weird sense, it's not bad news that chiba relies on their own vax. Mrna vaccines have already seen a fairly significant drop in effectiveness with omicron sub varients.
