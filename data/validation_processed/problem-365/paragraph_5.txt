Those same joke fucks are working to undermine US domestic security (power grid attacks by "domestic" terrorists), international relations (shoveling fossil fuels to China and India), and Democratic stability at a global level. Just to steal some land they willingly relinquished any right to DECADES ago in a treaty. The Russian government is a joke that can't reliably provide stability for its people, who they control by a frayed thread via state sponsored media. A travesty of modern governance on par with the failures of North Korea.
