This is about as surprising as Dems winning California. Like they did look vulnerable last election due to an agitation and lost many seats in their bastion. BUT this time main opposition party(congress) basically ignored the state and got their votes split by the new party AAP. Congress biggest face who is on an idiotic march across India basically took 2 rallies in the state and it showed as if they didn't care. Now they also lost a lot of candidates to the other parties but it's not like keeping those would've won the state anyway.
