And we support more armed groups and finance more government overthrows than Iran by far. How do you think Iran got in this mess in the first place. We staged coup in 1953 that destroyed their new democracy and put in a monarch instead. That monarch was finally overthrown in 1979. Had we not crushed their democracy to begin with, Iran would likely be a very different place.
