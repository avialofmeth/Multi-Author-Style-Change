    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 includes terms like 'Allies', 'Nazi-Germany', 'opposition', 'elections', 'freedom of the press' which are more specific and elaborate compared to the terms in Paragraph 2. The lexical variation and word choice differ significantly between the two texts.",

        "explanation": "Both paragraphs exhibit shorter sentence structures, but Paragraph 1 involves more speculative and hypothetical language, while Paragraph 2 is more straightforward and directive. The sentence structures and coherence differ in terms of narrative style.",
