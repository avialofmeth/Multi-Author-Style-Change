As for the "arrogance", without us you cannot do shit about encountering China. Someone's got to take your e waste and be the factory of the world if the West doesn't want to suck up to China (which explains why US is trying to woo us). India may not have the $$$ but it has a 1.4 billion people - this means endless potential for your fortune 500 in terms of consumer ship. No one wants to piss off a fifth of world's population for some propaganda and they know it.
