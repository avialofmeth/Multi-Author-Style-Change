Social Security has absolutely nothing to do with the national debt. It is funded by employee and employer contributions, not through income tax money. Republicans want to privatize SSI, so that their Wall Stteet buddies can steal hundreds of billions of dollars in commisions and management fees. Anything you hear about the national debt wirh regards to Social Security Insurance is complete BS.
