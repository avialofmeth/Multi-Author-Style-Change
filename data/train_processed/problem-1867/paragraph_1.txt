Flash back to age 23: Trial and error showed me that hormonal birth control doesn't mix well with my psych issues. IUDs caused me immense pain. After suffering mental health disturbances from hormonal birth control and having an IUD perforate my uterus, I was at wit's end. I had called dozens of doctors begging for a sterilization, but no one took me seriously. I was set in my decision to never have children, but doctor after doctor doubted me-- I was too young, too immature, and my poor little lady brain couldn't fathom such heavy decisions. I finally reached out to Planned Parenthood for guidance. They were able to advise me, get me in touch with an OBGYN surgeon, and ultimately allowed me to undergo a voluntary sterilization. Ten years later, I have zero regrets.
