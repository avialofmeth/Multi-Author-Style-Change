Nowadays, all countries should have autonomy over the alliances they prefer to strive for. If a country like Ukraine wishes to join an alliance with the EU or Russia, it should be the souvereign choice of their fairly elected leaders. Fuck all fraudulent practices during elections. No election may be perfect, but Russia runs one of the worst.
