This is an issue with a LOT of companies. I used to work for a Fortune 50 company that had incredibly dated internal software and didnâ€™t seem interested at all in changing things no matter how much IT pressed it. Weâ€™re talking hundreds of billions in valuation with a decades old system where you canâ€™t even change basic settings without risking the whole thing crashing. But hey the boss got an 8 figure bonus every year ðŸ˜¬.
