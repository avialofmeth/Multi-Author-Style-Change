Because more and more people keep entering the country every year this way and they’re for the most part, not the high-skilled and highly educated immigrants that a large consensus agrees we need to be attracting, most people either want immigration levels to stay the same or lower (and I don’t believe that when those polls inform people of what the numbers are that they even include people entering to apply for asylum), most studies have found that higher immigration leads to less support for welfare programs and I personally am in favor of more robust welfare schemes than we currently have, the way asylum works keeps people in limbo for years allowing them to set down roots when in the end the vast majority do not qualify for asylum. Credible fear screening is a very low bar to meet, but the bar for asylum is specific because it was not meant as a catch-all for people who do not qualify by other means, to migrate.
