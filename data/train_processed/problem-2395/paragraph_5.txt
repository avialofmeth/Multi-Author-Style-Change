The purpose of the senate is to prevent an excess of democracy, and it has served that purpose very well. Itâ€™s important to remember how few people actually voted for the Republican minority throwing a wrench into things. Gerrymandering has the same effect on the house (states are basically large gerrymandered districts without the requirement of roughly equal populations), though it would be a much more complicated graph with a smaller effect size.
