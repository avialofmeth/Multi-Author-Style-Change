Lets see where all the money has been going so far. they have been given ie (other countries have paid for) all of the miltary supplies to become a force that can now do serious damage if they want to other countries. They have been given billions of dollars in aid. Just recently most cabinet members have resigned because of embezzelment of untold amounts. They have been known as one of the most corrupt countries on earth for the last 25 years or so and now we have to give them more because zelensky says so. I understand the fact that wartime is aweful and expensive but other countries are going thru recessions shortages as well. Sorry for the rant.
