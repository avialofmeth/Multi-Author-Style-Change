Protecting Bristol Bay is (mostly) a bipartisan priority. Sure, the GOP is doing their typical performative whining about "state's rights" and "killing industry," but who typically support mining have long recognized that trading a $1.5 billion fishery supporting nearly 20,000 jobs for a temporary mine that would provide, at best, a few hundred is a terrible economic decision. Plus, there are a lot of recreational hunters and anglers in their constituency who don't want to see good fishing streams destroyed.
