I'm saying, the status of one has zero bearing on the status of the other. They both likely involve felonies being committed and in all likelyhood nothing will be done to either perpetrator. Biden's is getting worse as they continue to find more docs with some going back to his time in the Senate. No real way he had any legitimate right to remove those from a secure location. I have no idea whats happening with Trumps case because all anyone is reporting on currently is Biden. But I'm sure we'll gear more about him when. The investigation concludes.
