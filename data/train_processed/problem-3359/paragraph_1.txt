Anyone remember 10-15 years ago where we thought or at least assumed that Putin was some sort of mastermind, always playing 4d chess? And now it's obvious he's been kicked in the head a few many times, forces his impulsive & terrible decisions onto others, is completely disinterested in the massive suffering he causes his own people. We all assumed he was at least average intelligence, I mean he worked for the KGB Nope.
