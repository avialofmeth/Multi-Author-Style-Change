It's the second most populous country in the world, and is about to overtake China and become the most populous country in the world, so being the third largest producer of renewable energy isn't the bragging point you think it is. According to wikipedia India is the fifth largest producer of renewable electricity, after much less populous countries, such as Canada. What is important is the percentage of renewable energy, not the total, and only 21.7% of the electricity produced in India in 2021-2022 came from renewable sources, while 72.7% came from coal. 99% of the electricity produced in my country in 2021 came from renewable sources.
