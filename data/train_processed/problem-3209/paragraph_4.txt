2. State actors having proxy fights. Syria is propped up by Iran and borders Israel. Israel routinely strikes Syria and Iran routinely arms Syria to strike Israel. Golan Heights is of particular important here.

Always "contractors" (American) or "volunteers" (Russia) so that there isn't a direct confrontation between powers.
