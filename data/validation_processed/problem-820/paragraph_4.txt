I fear this could be 1 step closer towards to civil war in Iran. Depending on how brutal the Russian (a.k.a. foreign) security forces are, revolts and with that brutality could increase to the point Iranian Army could be forced by its people to intervene, which would threaten the regime and start a war between the army and protestors vs IRG.
