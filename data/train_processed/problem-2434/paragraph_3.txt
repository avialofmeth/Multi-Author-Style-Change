Most aren’t brand new. Most were used to import but since we don’t export as much as we import, we have surplus containers. Sure, if your building a fancy new home your contractor will order new, but the country has a shit load of lightly used containers for sale. Take a look at the picture, they are clearly used containers. So unless you want your contractor paying 10x as much for new, you buy a used one.
