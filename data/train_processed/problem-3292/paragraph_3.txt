The health care system is failing on so many levels. A lot of it is due to undervalued and understaffed crew..the nurses are all so exhausted and are yelled at all the time it's no wonder you don't get treated as kindly as you should. The kindness has been beaten out of them. Not only by their bosses but by the people who abuse the emergency system as well.
