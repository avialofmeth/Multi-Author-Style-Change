Downplaying an attempt to thwart the transfer of power and continuing to support and provide cover for the individuals who did it, the congress members who furthered it and the former president who’s will it was is a pretty massive distinction. As is getting millions to become vaccine conspiracists during a pandemic. Reducing it all to “both support corporate rule and are against workers” is the exact sort of simplification I was talking about, can’t even begin to catalogue the mountain of shit that ignores.
