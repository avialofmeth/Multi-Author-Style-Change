They stopped him, dragged him from the car because he wouldn't step out of the vehicle with out a legitimate reason. When he was put into an arm bar you can hear bone Crack.

They deployed tasers, missed him twice (after taking him once on the ground) they chased him down and proceeded to beat him. They didn't even get cuffs on him until mid to late beating.
