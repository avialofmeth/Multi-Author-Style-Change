Oh I agree, however corruption is a human problem and it is not the govt of Canada's role to manage the 600ish first nations territories eithin the larger borders. They want autonomy and so they somewhat have it. Its up to them to change for themselves. Investing in community services and local businesses could help a lot of people.
