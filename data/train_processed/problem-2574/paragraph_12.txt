I guess this is a hot take, but I blame the Democrats for this disaster. They saw this piece of garbage and chose not to run a stronger candidate. They saw this hot garbage pile skinwalking as a (sub)human and chose not to look into his past and let him take a previously Democratic stronghold. Unreal.
