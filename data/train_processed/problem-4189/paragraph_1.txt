I’m also an election judge in my county. When we did the Bobo/Frisch recount, there were less that 100 ballots where that contest wasn’t voted on at all. What that may mean is that those people hated Bobo, but couldn’t force themselves (too republican) to vote for Frisch or the other three candidates. I wonder how many other counties in her district had the same thing happen? Will Frisch learn from his loss and actually have a stance? I guess time will tell.
