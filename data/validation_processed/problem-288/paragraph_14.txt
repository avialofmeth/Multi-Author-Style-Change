Also, just for those unaware Perry is objectively terrible. He is a fascist, a criminal, he hates the EPA, his families business is responsible for poisoning his own constituents, he was directly involved in the insurrection and openly advocates for using the military to overthrow the US government. Among other terrible positions. Add to that the fact he is a retired general with real influence on the military just like Flynn and you can see why some of us have been concerned and advocating against this guy for the last 25 years. I honestly think if Perry got even a quarter the attention from the media and party they put into pointless other races Perry would have been gone years ago.
