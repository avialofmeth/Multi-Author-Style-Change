They may not have actually been going to kidnap him, but anyone with any sense would have been worried about it and everything it was reported that he said during and after about it points to that being the case. Let's not forget that January 6th was an attempted coup. The president was threatening Pence, people were screaming for him to be hung, they had a noose set up outside. Other staffers were refusing to get on buses for the same reason. They feared if they boarded them that they may never come back. The fact that there was even an inkling of a thought like that from anyone is shameful.
