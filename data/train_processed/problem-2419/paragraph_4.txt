Mastriano is refusing to concede the governorship in PA despite the fact he is losing by 13% (620k+ votes) with greater than 95% reporting in nearly every county except Montour which has 77% reporting but only a population of 18 . And Philly which is no way mastriano wins and Chester which again he won't win and a couple small counties.
