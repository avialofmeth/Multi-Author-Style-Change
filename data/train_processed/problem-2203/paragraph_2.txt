Either way, working in the media industry, you wouldn't really go down the route of pointing fingers directly. You would just say the truth and hope that prevails. However viewers have their own biases so the factual truth may not be theirs. The only way to stand out is just say facts as much as possible. Once you go down the route of directly pointing fingers you stop the goal being facts for the better of society - it also gives more power to those voices.
