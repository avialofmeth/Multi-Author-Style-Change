I was saying that the night of the debate. Barely anyone in PA watched it live - it wasn't even on TV. You had to stream it on a local ABC affiliate's website. What the majority of Pennsylvanian would end up seeing are the lowlights, which feature John Fetterman stammering and Dr. Oz blurring out "decision between her doctor and local politician". Obviously one of those was infinitely worse, like an actual titanic fuckup of a gaff.
