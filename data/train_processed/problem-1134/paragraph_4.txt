Naaa China imports most of its energy resources. They need the Saudis for their sweet sweet oil. The Saudis and China need the US to guarantee free passage of shipping. China has a huge fleet but very few ships are capable of blue water force protection over the distances needed to secure their oil supplies. Saudi also needs a guaranteed of their security. Their war against the Houthi’s have proven they are a mediocre military power despite all the hardware they buy. If a rival power like Iran decided to mix it up with the Saudis they’d roll them without our protection.
