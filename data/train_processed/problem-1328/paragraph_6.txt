Yeah, tribalism, specifically needing to be accepted by those who you call your peers out of fear of being shunned for breaking ranks, mixed with the fact that voting R and hating libs is preferable to researching and becoming informed about policy (or anything for that matter), especially when a large percentage of the GOP base are blue collar guys who work all week and would rather go fishing, hunting, catch up on chores, drink and party, or basically "check out" in their free time.
