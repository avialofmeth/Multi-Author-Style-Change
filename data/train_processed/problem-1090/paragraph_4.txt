Yep, this is exactly how my mom quit smoking. Cold Turkey / tapering never worked for her so she bought some rechargeable & refillable e-cigs (w/ extra batteries), got various strenhs of vape juice, and just gradually diluted it over time until she got all the way down to 0mg Nicotine then just forced herself to put it down for good.
