I'm not asking anyone to defend my life. If a country attacks mine or vice versa I have the right to decide if I think the conflict is worth fighting for or not. If its not then my death is not the automatic outcome even if my country losses. I'd have to weigh the consequences of that situation out and decide if I thought it was worth it or not.
