In large parts of Africa Facebook is literally the only Internet access they have. They've made a special version of the app that users can access even if they have no mobile data credit. Something like 90% of Africans access their Internet through a mobile device and do not own a computer or Wi-Fi so all the news, entertainment and search results are delivered directly via Meta.
