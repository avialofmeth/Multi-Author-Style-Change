The same people who believe trickle down and that by bringing in less money and increasing spending can reduce the deficit. It's getting to the point where you have to be old to remember any time republicans might have cared about the budget. You would have to go back to before Reagan to find a republican who didn't explode the deficit. So I would assume that 90% of people who believe republicans care about the deficit are older. It's kind of hard to convince 30 and 40 year olds that republicans are good for the deficit despite republicans never reducing the deficits when in power once in our lives.
