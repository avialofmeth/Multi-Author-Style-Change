That's what these regimes essentially are. In their minds, the only way to maintain control is through fear and pain. This is partly because they enjoy it, and partly because their religion/culture/political influences have been built up with all this as doctrine. If your ancient scholars say you need to quell rebellion with public executions, what else are you to do? Certainly not consider other options.
