Republicans get a win-win. If they don't act and it causes catastrophe, they likely regain control of the government in 2-4 years. If they cave, they still get to cry afoul of Democrats wasting money and being fiscally irresponsible. it's not true, but it doesn't have to be. People will still blame the Democrats. It's so annoying.
