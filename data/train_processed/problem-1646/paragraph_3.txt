This is why the professional political class was able to "stop politics at the shores" and more or less present a united front internationally, because they knew deep down their BS was just BS....and they could do what was needed and then attack some culture war topic at election season again. (Ie. Ted Cruz and his war on limiting the number of dildos a woman in Texas can own).
