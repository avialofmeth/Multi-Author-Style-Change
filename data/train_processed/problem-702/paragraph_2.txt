The way scientific press releases are typically drafted is that they go through a "public information officer", or PIO. The PIO is a journalist, and is generally not a specialist in the field they're writing about. Their job is to interview the scientists, broadly understand the research they've done, and then summarize that research in a way that can be understood by a general audience.
