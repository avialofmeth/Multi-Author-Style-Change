I see.. So people smoking is the same thing as people genetically manipulating genes of others, with no idea the ancillary consequences? You seem to be an expert on false analogies for sure, the rest? not so much...tripling down on stupidity still leaves the fact that it is stupidity in the first place...it is the internet though, so a quadrupling down and more false analogies are sure to come. Let the logical fallacies continue sir.
