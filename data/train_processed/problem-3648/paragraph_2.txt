No, this guy Luc Michel really is a Belgian self-identified Stalinist in Belgium. It's the Russian fake news network that's in Africa. It should be noted that although Michel calls himself a Stalinist, he was the founder of a Neo-Nazi group and is currently the leader of a Belgian National Bolshevik party, which as an ideology is basically Nazism plus Stalinism. It's Stalinism but with Nazi-style antisemitic rhetoric.
