Respectfully thinking people can’t pay attention to other matters AND this seems to wickedly undersell peoples ability to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. Toning down pretty egregiously bad stuff in the spirit of not putting up a noticeable fuss is part of the reason Santos got elected. I’m not sure how suggesting the media continue to do it’s charade of reforming Greene by toning down her nonsense is an intelligent idea for keeping people informed of the things that impact them. No one else seems to have a problem with noticing other things also going wrong.
