Its not about gaining new voters its about using any means necessary to enforce a white Christian nationalist agenda on America. Violence, lies threats is completely justified in order to reach those goals. The GOP might implode but they will take down the government with it. These people are religious zealots and we need to take that seriously. History has shown over and over again zealots are extremely dangerous.
