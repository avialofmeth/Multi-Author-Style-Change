As for Russian massive defeat, there is no need. Both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union fell in part because of military defeats, but never outright existential defeat. Which was preceded by declining quality of life (Tsarist Russia: famine, Soviet Russia: long supermarket queues). Right now we are seeing an almost exact redux of the past two Russian collapses in the making all the worse elements mixed and matched in one. (Not that a new regime will be any better, but full balkinazation of Russia is entirely possible very soon).
