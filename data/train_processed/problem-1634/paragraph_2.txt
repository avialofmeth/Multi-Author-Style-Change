For anyone wondering about the “red wave” that only seemed to happen in Florida… DeSantis cheated HARD by extreme racial gerrymandering, and disenfranchising voters who completed their sentences, but might have owed money to the state. Also, mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day, but received after 7pm, were NOT COUNTED and tossed out.
