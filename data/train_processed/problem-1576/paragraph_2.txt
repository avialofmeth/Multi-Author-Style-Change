India’s government has no useful input whatsoever, ever. They just open their mouths and hope something smart comes out. Like this imbecile of an official, suggesting Ukraine return to diplomacy, after the countless Russian atrocities on innocent Ukrainians, raping children, woman, men, the abductions and forced orphaning, chemical weapon use, the Russian soldier that cut off a Ukrainians dick and filmed it, etc etc. I’m sure the shit coming out of her mouth would turn to liquid gold real quick were Russia invading India instead.
