Nothing other than undermining the entire alliance and making the sitting leadership look weak or pro-Russian. NATO membership is a stepping stone to hosting troops in an allied nation though, which would mean that an aggressive nation would have to attack NATO troops in order to invade them. Which would almost certainly bring the US into a war. US troops are deployed in the Baltic States, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania so Russia can't attack those countries without attacking the US.
