That being said, I feel like the opposition is more grounded against content that would pop up in Unit 4 as being explicitly from a Critical Race Theory perspective. Like, page 25 straight up says Topic 4.15 is on texts from Kimberlé Crenshaw and Angela Davis, who are very much connected to CRT. And for the right, that is evidence that “CRT is being taught in K12 schools,” or is at least being pushed.
