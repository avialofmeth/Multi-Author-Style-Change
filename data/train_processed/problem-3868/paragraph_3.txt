Here's the thing, that not exactly your choice, theychave really fucked up laws around interrogation. I don't remember the exact time, but I think they can hold you up to 48 hours without a lawyer where mild assault is basically condoned and they can deprive you of sleep. This probably isn't the average experience, but not without precedent.
