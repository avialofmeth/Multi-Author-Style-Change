Background: Andrej Babiš, one of the Czech Presidential candidates, said on live TV that as president, he would not send troops to Poland or The Baltics in case of an attack. Polish media picked the story up (and rightfully so) and now Babiš's team is in full damage control mode. It is also important to note that it wasn't a simple misunderstanding, he firmly stood behind his opinion.
