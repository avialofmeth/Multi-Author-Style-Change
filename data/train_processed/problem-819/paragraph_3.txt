Well, due to helping Russia so much Hungary has been rewarded by having their main oil pipeline destroyed today in the bombardments (it's in Ukraine). Since I really heavily doubt Ukraine will send anyone to repair it anytime soon (and odds of Russia doing so are even lower) - the whole country is going to be utterly screwed within next month or two.
