Yeah that is the egregious thing. Whenever our allies called, we came. Kosovo, Afghanistan, Mali and so on. Our Soldiers died in Wars that nobody in Germany wanted. We built half the military equipment our allies use and maintain it. We were ready to get nuked in the cold war to stem the tide . Even the implication of this after we so thoruoghly sanctioned Russia that NorthKorea is shocked and delivering Billions in lethal aid and ten Billion in Humanitarian Aid to Russias enemies is so incredibly insulting, so stupendously outrageous that it is hard to put into words.
