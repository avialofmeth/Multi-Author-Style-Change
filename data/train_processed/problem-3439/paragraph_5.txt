The party voted at their convention to endorse McMullin over , who was trying to make it a D vs. R vs. I race. Arizona parties don't use conventions to nominate, so if someone files as a Democrat and gets enough ballot qualification signatures they'll be on the primary ballot and will win the nomination, even if the party as an organization nominally doesn't want to do that (although from everything state party leaders here are putting out, and from the signaled interest in the seat by both Gallego and Stanton, they don't look like they'd have wanted that anyway).
