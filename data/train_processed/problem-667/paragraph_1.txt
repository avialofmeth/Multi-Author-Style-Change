You don’t want to die - don’t go to war - easy. You do understand that in the beginning these were mostly volunteers and contractors who invaded Ukraine? Probably still are. Wagner and other private companies are 100% contractors + criminals serving 10-15 years who were offered pardon if they serve. Famously, one of the guys they “recruited” is a cannibal and a serial killer. As of right now, the average age of dead Russians is 30-35 years old, according to BBC. Kids my ass, they are all grown men murderers. Marvel is a fairly tale, what’s going on in Ukraine is unfortunately very real. Of course they don’t want to die. I hope they do.
