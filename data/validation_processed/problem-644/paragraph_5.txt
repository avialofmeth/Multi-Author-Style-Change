I dont believe there was direct collusion trump was aware of, but i do believe putin meddled without trump being totally knowledgable about it. Im sure he had inklings, but their relationship seems less to me like a direct collaboration, it seems like trump definitely did a bit to pacify him for a time without capitulting too much of ACTUAL consequence, aside from embarassing himself at press conferences.
