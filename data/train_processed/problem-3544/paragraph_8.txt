To put it another way--it means that a single government could, for example, turn Israel into a theocracy overnight, destroy democracy, issue any insane law it wants without anyone to stop them. In the absence of separation of powers within the context of the parliament (such formalities as the UK House of Lords or the king that will have the power to stop parliament if they decide to do something evil that will threaten the people), the Supreme Court is absolutely necessary.
