There is also one very important distinction in those two situations. When our forces were fighting off Russians from inside of our cities they had to be there, because if there were no soldiers in them, then Russians would simply enter and capture them. But Russians don’t need to be inside of their own towns and cities to defend them, nobody is going to enter Russia and try to capture their cities, so they are using their own civilian infrastructure to attack us from, when they don’t have to do it.
