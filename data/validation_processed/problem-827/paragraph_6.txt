It’s just an algorithm that synthesizes an argument in response to a prompt. It’s hardly SkyNet. I’m more concerned about people using these machine learning programs to make arguments their behalf rather than invent their own arguments. That, and jobs being siphoned off by algorithms and leaving otherwise employable people high and dry.
