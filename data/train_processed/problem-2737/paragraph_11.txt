LMAO oh yeah, a ship being in the water near the war really turned the tide didn’t it? So god damn dramatic, as if the US dropped a nuke on New Delhi lol. The USSR wasn’t going to go to war for India for the same reasons the US wasn’t. Nobody gives a shit about two third world countries who argue like a married couple, and nobody was going to nuclear war over it.
