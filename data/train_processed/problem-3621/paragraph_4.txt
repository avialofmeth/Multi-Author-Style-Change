His current health insurance arrangement is the option to buy a policy on the exchange with an employer contribution. My thought is that, given that it is required to be a gold-level plan and that young men typically don't use much/any healthcare, he is paying a lot more for his share of the premium than he would pay with no insurance. I would expect that he will have the usual COBRA option, and that would definitely cost a crazy amount.
