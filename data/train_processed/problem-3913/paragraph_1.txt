It's far from over, but I highly doubt it'll be stagnant. First, Ukraine doesn't necessarily need to attack across the Dnipro from Kherson, they could advance along the left bank from Zaporizhzhia until they secure a safe crossing for the Kherson flank. Second, it's the wet months of fall and spring that slow down offensives due to muddy conditions; Hard ground from snow is doable. (Russia's offensives last winter weren't necessarily stalled by the snow; they were stalled by equipment that was not maintained effectively to work in winter, yes... and dogshit logistics... and then General Mud in Spring... and Ukraine's stiff defensives.) And finally, Ukraine is being supplied with effective gear for winter (with the correct maintenance too).
