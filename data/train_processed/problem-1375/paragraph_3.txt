Great to hear that GLSDBs were finally officially announced, it was enough to make Medvedev throw yet another nuclear tantrum, saying that “Ukraine will burn” if we hit Crimea, yeah right. Did he forget that we hit Crimea many times already? And he promised us a judgement day for hitting it before, but for some reason it didn’t happen even though we destroyed an entire air base with a lot of their planes after his promise. Do Russians really not see how weak they look by constantly threatening nuclear war and never backing up their words? Either do it already, or stop with your stupid threats, which are not being taken seriously anyway, or we wouldn’t be getting tanks and long-range weapons right now.
