OMG yes! I had a family member use that and I looked him directly in the eye and said "Your generation invented them, you think any of us actually wanted these things? It always weirded us out how often all of you saved the useless ribbons and trophies to prove how much better you were than someone else even though all of us had the same ribbon. Now you want to scream about it? Where was your outrage when we were complaining they were lame?".
