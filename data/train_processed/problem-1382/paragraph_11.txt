Then Aristide left office in 1996 because the constitution doesn't allow for consecutive terms. His vice-president Rene Preval succeeded him and became the first ever elected leader in Haitian history to serve a full term in office. Preval saw massive reforms to the economy and decreased unemployment. Aristide was then elected to a second term in office but his term witnessed a rebel insurgency in 2004. The rebels were a loose alliance of criminal gangs and former military officers. They were able to take over part of the countryside and captured some major towns. The rebels were joined by the death squad leaders of the previous military dictatorship. When the rebels were on the verge of capturing Port-au-Prince, Aristide resigned and left the country. A UN intervention lead by the US, Canada and France defeated the rebels but chose not to restore Aristide to office.
