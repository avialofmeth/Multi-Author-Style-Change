Again, since you seem to have a single argument; Russia started the war, ask yourself who's benefitting from perpetuating it. Maybe one of the most corrupt governments in the EU, the country which greatly profits off of it's military industrial complex (which has also been meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine's territories bordering Russia and identify heavily as soviet), and the group of nations with an identity complex because of it's past?
