It was a risk, but the payoff now is that most are going to dial back the crazy rhetoric a lot. None of these fucksticks believed their bullshit, they were spouting it to try and get votes and it failed. The ones who lost are going to keep it up, but they'll mostly be out of the limelight over the next two or three months. The rest will still be trying to doom and gloom to drum up their base (which honestly, both sides pull that on their base, but Republicans doom and gloom over fictitious scenarios) but it will shift from stolen elections and qanon crazy to DeSantis' anti wokeness message. Not that that is much better, but one thing at a time.
