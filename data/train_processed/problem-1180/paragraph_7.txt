Russia had already ceased supply through the pipeline blaming technical problems before the explosion. The idea that Putin blew up a Russian pipeline (worth billions to their economy) as a warning to the west is simply nuts. Why would he not have, say, blew up the new Norway-Poland pipeline? How is the fact that the explosion happened on that day proof that Russians did it? It’s clear, from the details of the story and the fact that there has been effective media silence about it, that this was done by the West. Also stop trying to understand geopolitics through amateur psychoanalysis, it’s nauseatingly stupid.
