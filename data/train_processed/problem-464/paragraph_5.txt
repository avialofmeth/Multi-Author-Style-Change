Let's be clear. Supporting Ukraine, a large country with a large population, and with several shared borders with NATO countries, and with 8 years to ramp up their preparedness after Putin's land grab in 2014, is a far easier prospect than somehow stopping Russia from overwhelming a tiny country like Georgia in the middle of central Asia. (And even that wasn't a full invasion.).
