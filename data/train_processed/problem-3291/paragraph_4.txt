You can’t just say you’re going to blockade a country —you must also enforce it. The waters around Taiwan are one of the most busy areas for maritime traffic. Lots of ships, not just those bound for Taiwan, traverse the Straits. Crucial imports and exports for Japan, South Korea and even China itself would be at risk. All three are net food and energy importers with an outsized export footprint, just like Taiwan. This means you can't just shoot at any ship in the area like the Germans did in the Atlantic, you must patrol, intercept, board and potentially seize merchant ships, a logistically challenging undertaking even if China had complete naval dominance in the area, which it does not. The chance of misunderstanding with a Japanese or Korean ship spiralling out of control.
