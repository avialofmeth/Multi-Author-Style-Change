I don't know if it was by design or not, but NATO slow-walking artillery in stages to the Ukrainians has been devastating to Russian supplies. Every time we roll out a new artillery system that increases the range of Ukrainian fire missions, Russia loses a whole mess of ammo and supply depots and is forced to push them even further back.
