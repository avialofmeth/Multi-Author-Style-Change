That also goes both ways. Nancy Pelosi IMO also contributed to this crap allowing and also providing her own, Trump level disconnected opinions to further divide the American people and then bailed as soon as she realized the repercussion's of her falsehoods. When you speak words, they matter. I don't advocate for hostility but when you lie in the extremes you get more extreme as displayed repeatedly over the past years. Stop stoking dem flames and slimply start doing your job.... Pass legislation to help protect American people.
