By and large the judiciary in the US is, in fact, independent. The fact that the judiciary may return a decision that offends one part of the electorate or another from time to time is immaterial to that fact. Judges, and even justices, can be removed from office following very specific mechanisms found in the constitution. That such mechanisms have only rarely been employed, and only under egregious circumstances is a sign of that independence.
