I don't think most people understand heroin addicts or heroin addiction, IMO morphine is not even that good of a pain killer, it shifts the mind set of people, it does diminishes pain but it makes you "feel good" and that is what's dangerous, especially if there's history of depression or shit like that, the "makes you feel good" becomes stronger. So if you know anybody going through that shit and you have the balls to stand by them do it, without methadone they will need You.
