As much as i'd love to be in NATO overnight I don't think it's going to be that simple. Turkey is a major military power in their area and they control the straits of Bosporus and indirectly the Black Sea because of their position. If that position was switched to be hostile towards the West and more aligned with Russian military interests it'd require new planning and doctrine, not to mention that "overruling" a single country's vote when it comes to NATO accession would fuel the anti-NATO sentiment of "haha, the imperialistic US is saying what you can or can't do Look at them fascists".
