"Stolen" isn't really used in a legal sense here. Most of the African artifacts in European museums were taken as bounties of war or were taken by an empire during the colonial period. None of this was illegal at time (though there was also plenty of illegal grave robbing ect.). It is by today's moral standards that we regard this as theft not necessarily by legal ones.
