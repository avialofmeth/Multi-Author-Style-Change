Did you know California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Texas and parts of Colorado, Idaho and Oregon were a part of Mexico. We invaded in 1846 and in 1848 we just took them. Ah Manifest Destiny. You think that dumbass Trump knows this? You know what we invaded about? The border between us and Mexico. It was always the Nueces River but the Texans claimed without valid evidence it was the Rio Bravo del Norte ( Rio Grande).
