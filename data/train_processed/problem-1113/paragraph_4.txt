The question comes down to just how crazy/demanding the MAGA nuts in the House turn out to be. It could be that McCarthy has to promise them so much just to get the job that he'll never be able to actually govern. And while that might be fine with the MAGAs, not every Republican is on board with that as a philosophy.
