According to who LOL? We have one of the best trained forces in the world, but our hardware is outdated and in horrible condition. We can’t keep 4 submarines operational, our frigates have been outdated for decades, and our fighter jets are Australian hand me downs. Hardware upgrades are coming in the next couple decades, but it’s not exactly a top tier force right now.
