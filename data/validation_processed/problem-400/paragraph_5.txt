This seems like one of the better outcomes of a GOP majority. Whatâ€™s the hurry to get a speaker in place? WTF is a GOP speaker going to even do?? They may as well just embarrass themselves for as long as possible while nothing gets done because the alternative is endless Hunter-Ghazi hearings and also nothing getting done.
