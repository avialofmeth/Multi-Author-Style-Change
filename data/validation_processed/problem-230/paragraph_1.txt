The goal of tax code reform is to make what people are actually paying in tax, to be what we collectively expect them to be paying. Not allow any more of this nonsense tax jargon "well I carried forward losses on a depreciated international investment quantitatively offset by a high rate loan counted as a second residence through an LLC with 3 other principal ownership parties... so while I made 100 million last year, I actually lost money when you look at my balance sheet. See, no taxes needed! What are all those losses from? Well you see 15 years ago the government passed a 1 year temporary tax break and that year I made billions, according to my balance sheet.".
