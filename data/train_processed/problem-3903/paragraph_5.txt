Russian Constitution seems meaningless as the court system is completely corrupt. How else can you convict someone of "discrediting the army" by calling this massive war, a war? Or holding a blank piece of paper, or singing a Ukrainian song or even can you believe it wearing a blue jacket with yellow shoes. Someone recently arrested for putting flowers on a Ukraine monument in Russia after many innocent children killed in apartment bombing. Meanwhile they released murderers after 6 months service in illegal PMC Wagner. No justice in Russia. Laws just for show and suppression.
