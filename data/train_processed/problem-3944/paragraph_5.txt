Trump echos his base. He poll tests his lines at the rallies and repeats whatever works. In some sense, Trump is the purest distillation of what the Republican base wants. I highly doubt the Republicans will be able to expel Trump without losing some of their base. Also, I doubt their base will allow them to moderate their policies.
