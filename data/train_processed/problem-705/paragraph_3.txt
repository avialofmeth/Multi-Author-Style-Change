I really believe the Dems got so much backlash after Biden's pronouncement that Congress should force the unions to take the Temporary Labor Agreement as is, that it spooked them into this. The Dems will move if progressives pressure them. Same thing LBJ said to MLK, Jr. back in the 60's: "force my hand".
