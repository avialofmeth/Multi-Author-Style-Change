they're basically using him as a battering ram to push the country further right...there have been a number of republicans who have realigned themselves with dems, but the long haul GOPers put up with it because it lets them be more crazy cuz "at least they aren't Trump"...i had a FOX news watching family member tell me he wouldn't vote for Trump again, but would hope someone more reasonable "like Tom Cotton" gets the nod...like holy shit if Tom Cotton is a mark of reason...we're fucked.
