I don’t disagree and I’m not rooting for or against either of these folks. My main point is that we can’t say Bidens infractions we’re no big deal simply because Trumps were worse. I’m also not at all ready to accept that this was an accident because he gave them back. From what I understand, he would have had to initially view them in a secured facility. How do they then wind up in his garage by accident? Did he fold them up and put in his pocket and accidentally walk out? That doesn’t make any sense to me. I think it’s probable that he took them for some reason and that eventually we’ll have to deal with that. But again, this seems to be a pretty common occurrence and I would be shocked if either the current or former President are charged with anything serious. More likely a finger wag and stern warning not to do that again. The powerful are rarely/never held accountable.
