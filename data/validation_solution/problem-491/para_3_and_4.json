  },
  "feature2": {
    "explanation": "Paragraph 1 displays a more varied lexical and grammatical style with complex terms related to mental health and medication.

    "score": 0.3
  },
  "feature3": {
    "explanation": "Paragraph 1 is more elaborate in sentence structure and content, discussing personal experiences and the journey with mental health.

  "feature4": {
    "explanation": "Paragraph 1 adopts a narrative style to detail personal struggles and mental health issues, evoking a tone of introspection and vulnerability.

  "overall": {
    "explanation": "Considering the distinct differences in punctuation style, lexical and grammatical features, sentence structure and content, and narrative styles between the two texts, the likelihood of them being written by the same author is low.
