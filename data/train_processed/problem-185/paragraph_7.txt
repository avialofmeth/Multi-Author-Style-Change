no. but for something someone wants to label "the greatest film of all time." i'd have expected to have atleast heard about it before now. i've studied film, and cinematography. i come from an acting and film background. i work professionally in lighting for film/events. i enjoy cinema. so i dunno, i figured if its such hot shit id have heard of it.
