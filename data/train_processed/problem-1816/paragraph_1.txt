Correct. It's basically impossible that something larger than a baseball and closer than halfway to the Moon can enter US airspace without our knowledge. And heck, that's probably wrong because that is based on public information from 20 years ago, so we can probably count the hairs on a gnat by now. No way 3 busses worth of balloon flying over missile silos is anything other than tracked all to hell and back.
