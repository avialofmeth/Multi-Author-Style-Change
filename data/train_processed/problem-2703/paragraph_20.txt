On top of this its not like the DPRK is any position to make threats. Militarily its 50 years behind Russia and thats saying a lot with the information we have now. conventionally or strategically they are fucked in a first strike situation and they know it. Hell if they could win in either scenario why not just take over the South at any point? why haven't they tried again yet?
