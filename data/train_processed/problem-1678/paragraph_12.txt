The thing about Vietnam is that it wasn't an invasion though. It was a civil war and one side (albeit the more corrupt side) welcomed the United States. So the United States wasn't necessarily there illegally. Still you can bet your ass the north Vietnamese treated every American soldier like a criminal as they should have. Still Vietnam isn't a very good analogy to Ukraine.
