Considering that the highest rank in Russian army has never served in army, yes iâ€™m talking about Shoigu, and how russia failed this bs invasion. I think Gerasimovâ€™s outcome will be as bad as shoigu. Too old, too corrupted, too drunk(yeah you can find YouTube clips when Gerasimov is drunk in front of soldiers ðŸ¤£).
