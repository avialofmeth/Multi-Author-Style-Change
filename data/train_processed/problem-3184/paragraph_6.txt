You can't have airports without good SAMs and even then they are still target for hypersonic missiles. If we sell/give them a bunch of jets and the get blown up too easily it hurts the war effort more than it helps... for sure. We can't just bang out f16s by the hundreds per month. We build them over time and add them to stockpiles unless we are in full war mobilization mode, which hasn't happened since ww2.
