That’s just not the case though, when you have no NCOs in your units that further ties your officers to NCO level tasks. They have to work down. I kinda get what you are saying, their seniority is amplified in a sense but it’s not reality. If you have a company of troops and you take away the corporals and sergeants then your lieutenants don’t become captains, your lieutenants end up having to act as corporals and sergeants, and then the captain ends up having to work steps down as well. Without NCOs you end up even increasing the threshold for what a “high ranking officer” is.
