I'm not saying it is wrong for the UK to help, far from it, but I am saying there were other motives for helping. Johnson only ever thinks of Johnson. He's been like that throughout his entire life. He did say let the body bags pile high during the pandemic so he's not worried about people needlessly dying unless it is himself.
