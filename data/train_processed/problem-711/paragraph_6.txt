Trump also actively disparaged our allies over and over again, in my opinion looking to break ties with us allies as early as 2016/2017. Look what he did to the Kurds, he literally got them to take their defenses down and then purposely pulled out our troops out and allowed them to be massacred, and handed Russia a US airbase.
