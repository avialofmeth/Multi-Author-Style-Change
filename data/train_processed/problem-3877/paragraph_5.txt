Listened to a show on NPR the other day where they talked about it, and how thereâ€™s going to need to be a lot of pain switching to electric furnaces on the north east coat what with blizzards knocking out power, and I was like; a shit ton of gas furnaces and ovens stop working when the power goes out anyways, because they have safer electric starters instead of pilot lights and thermostats are electric as well. Not once was it even mentioned, even to the point where they linked gas stoves to emergency heating, which you are NEVER supposed to do.
