If you've ever been in a western port (or just about anywhere but russia really) you'll notice they offer shore services (power, clean water etc). In their infinite wisdom, russia decided that they don't need to do that, the ships can do things for themselves. So when a russian ship sits in port, it's boilers are always running, wasting bunker oil, trying to desalinize it's own water - all that stuff.
