From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.
