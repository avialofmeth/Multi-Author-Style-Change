This is the best explanation I’ve read yet to those of us outside of Peru. The government is infighting for who gets the most power and in that receives the biggest benefit from the corruption? The people aren’t fighting for one side or the other in large then? (I know you have some that fall for one government propaganda or the other but I’m taking about the majority) They want they whole thing to go down so they can build what the people desire? The answers to this questions I’ve read today are so incredibly biased toward one narrative or the other I suspected what you just stated to be the closest to what is actually going on.
