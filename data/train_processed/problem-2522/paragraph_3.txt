I think it’s gonna be tough bc the Republican governor and legislature shortened early voting days very drastically after Ossoff and Warnock won last time. This has made lines so long. It’s really hard for a lot of ppl to wait in line for hours when they have little free time anyway, or if they have health problems, or small children.
