We have only been here since August. We came, it shut down a little bit, no lock ins just mass city wide testing. The same test and go stuff and the qr code check in everywhere. But now, there is nothing, I have been and tested at the booths this Monday and Tuesday and I still don't have the results on the app which makes it completely useless, that being said you now don't need it to do anything. The school provided us with rapid lateral flow tests. My wife and I are triple vaccinated and have both had it before so we don't really care about it's spread 🤷🏼‍♂️.
