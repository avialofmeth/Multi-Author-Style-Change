When I was teaching small children I realized that there was a certain number of children who delighted in doing things like standing at the top of the ladder so no one could go down the slide, or twisting the swings so they were unusable or running off with the soccer ball so no one could play. It appears that the Republicans have gathered a large group of these children in one place and are now complain that the playground isnâ€™t fun anymore.
