The Islamic Republic's enemy is not the US or Israel, it is their own citizens. It always has been. It's why until this movement, everybody in my life or family, no matter where in the world we lived outside of Iran, was silent about this regime in public. Because they literally watch what those of us in the diaspora say. And none of us could ever return if we said anything openly critical of them.
