What if I told you democracy died in the US in the year 2000 when the Supreme Court literally appointee a President against the wishes of the people? We’re basically just living through the death throes of the Republic now. The New American empire, ala Rome, is just getting going. The next centuries will be largely authoritarian, especially as humanity crumbles from climate change and desperate people seek strongmen to save them from famine or climate immigrants. I’m stoned but this is the real situation we are in.
