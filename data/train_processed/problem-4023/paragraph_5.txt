But if you dig deep enough, you can still find a pretty fair account of the situation from the anti-establishment left. Look at Noam Chomsky interviews since the war began. He thinks the American MIlitary Industrial Complex is corrupt as all hell, has a heavy influence on our media, and wants to keep this war going. That is not to say that the Kremlin are the good guys or that the war is "just". But it's a good place to start. The Jacobin Magazine is pretty fair as well.
