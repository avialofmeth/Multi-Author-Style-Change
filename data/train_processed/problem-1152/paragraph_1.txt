3. GOP didn’t lose as much as for the 2nd time in 2 years, Warnock overcame the GOP machine and won this race. He’s a winner and if he chooses to one day, I could see him doing very well if he decided to run for POTUS. Doesn’t mean he’s the perfectly ideological ally for me, but he just survived a tsunami of personal attack ads and negative GOP campaigning that was nonstop and vicious. I live in Tennessee but close enough to GA that my airwaves were bombarded with it. The fact that Warnock emerged relatively unscathed says a lot about him as a future possibility.
