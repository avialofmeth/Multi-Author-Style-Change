The Southern states on the Eastern Border have a lot of advantages that the Northern States do not. As mentioned, you have the depth to recover from initial losses, and Ukraine and Moldova completely stand between ruzzia and Romania. Slovakia has partial defense through Ukrainian borders too, with most of the rest of Slovakia's border being covered by Poland. In order for Romania to be invaded, ruzzia has to either launch an entire naval attack in the Black Sea, something we have seen they are not very capable of, or invade all the way through Ukraine or Poland, both of which are very unlikely to succeed. Add in some major terrain factors, including large and difficult to pass mountain ranges and wide rivers, and Romania is pretty damn safe from ruzzia all told. Any attack would take weeks to break through just Ukraine, let alone into Romania, which would give NATO way more than enough time to send reinforcements.
