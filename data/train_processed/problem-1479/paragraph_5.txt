Yeah you're not going to be able to gaslight me. Clinton kicked their asses. Clinton got the budget surplus and then the next Republican squandered it. Biden has been a great president. Far better than I'd hoped for. Seventy percent of Gen Z is democrat. The boomers are starting to die off. You've lost three straight national elections including with this crazy inflation. You have won the popular vote exactly one time in the past eight presidential elections. Your party's platform is to gut social security and Medicare and institute a twenty-five percent sales tax. It really doesn't matter what you say. Republicans only can about the national debt when a Democrat is president.
