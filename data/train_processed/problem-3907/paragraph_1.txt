Whaaat? I didn't realize our mitochondria had their own special DNA. That's awesome! Thanks for explaining this to me. I appreciate your skepticism about my diagnosis--I certainly hope I'm wrong about it. I'm seeking advice from a genetic counselor because I've been frail since birth and as an adult I'm still struggling to keep my weight above 90lbs. My general practicioner ordered a whole genome sequence which flagged two "pathologic" mutations, including that I'm a carrier of MCIID and suggested I might have a disorder like MERS or Leighs' Syndrome. My mom's side is french canadian so we've got a lot of weird neurological disorders in our DNA, lol.
