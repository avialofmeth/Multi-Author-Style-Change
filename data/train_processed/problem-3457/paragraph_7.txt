Yeah, your blanket “run moderates in swing districts” statement was simplistic, and that’s why I commented. It depends on the district and candidates as well and the issues they choose to lean into. You have to run good candidates that campaign their butts off to connect with their constituents. Purple states are just big gerrymandered districts, so I disagree with you on that. Same rules apply. Turn out your base and run on a message with broad appeal everywhere in the district.
