Honestly, BBC WS is one of the only news radio stations I can still stand listening to any more. They’re professional and present the facts, instead of ranting and raving; they cover news from all over the world, which has made me more aware of geopolitics and events outside my country. That’s how I learned about the recent end of the Tigray War, about the Sri Lanka President fleeing the country earlier this year, the unrest in South Africa, etc.
