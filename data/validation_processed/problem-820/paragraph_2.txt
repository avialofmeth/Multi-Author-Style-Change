The Iranian protesters are armed especially in areas where there's a large population of Kurds, there's videos of guns battles happening between the protesters and goverment forces. Guns are flowing from Kurdish factions outside of Iran, I'd also wager other Middle Eastern powers will supply arms to the protesters. Russias armed forces is way too busy in Ukraine and their State police forces are way too busy suppressing their own people to really effectively help Iran out.
