I don't get it. Conservatives always always always fall in line. The GOP always walks in lock-step. Talk of there being some civil war within the GOP sounds more like wishful thinking and fantasy. There isn't a single representative saying the Justice Dept should indict Trump even when they are supposedly distancing themselves. Not a single one thinks getting Trump out of the way is more important than Hunter Biden's laptop. They're still bending reality and pushing the narratives the same way they have for the last 6 years. A couple public statements that aren't entirely flattering and people start thinking there's a fault line forming in the GOP. That's impossible. Don't believe it. Any division will be sorted out very soon and they'll be attacking democracy full-time again like they have been.
