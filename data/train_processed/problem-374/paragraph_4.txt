He is not saying it is an excuse, what he is trying to get at is don't read this as a commentary/reflection on Oregon leadership. Both political parties have a tendency to believe that anyone who is a leader of either party reflects the values and attitudes of the whole party, especially when it fits a narrative that the other side is ALL "crazy" or "rapists". Again, he wasn't excusing it, he just didn't want extreme assumptions to be made.
