Nah dude, I follow it on opposition and independent media all the time. They are actually quite optimistic and keep saying the prosecution is winning, even in the battles the pro Bibi media claims as detrimental to the prosecution, usually there's a legal win that was ignored in the pro Bibi article. As an Israeli lawyer I tend to agree with the "prosecution is winning" narrative, as the legal case is substantial and they are gaining most of their legal goals, but they are suffering great losses in the public opinion battle.
