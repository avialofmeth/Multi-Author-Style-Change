So, to fight that system, we dont go to work. This is why we are kept living paycheck to paycheck. It's a treadmill designed to keep people too tired to think, and pursue meaning. Too busy to think. Too distracted by the fear of running out. Poverty is violence against the poor. Life is getting more expensive by the day, and we are not getting out what we put in.
