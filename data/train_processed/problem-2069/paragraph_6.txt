They fear that if they do that, they will watch the country burn down. There's an old film about an insurrection or something similar, where the government doesn't go against the leg that wanted to do mutiny because of that. Going publicly against them would incite the opposition to start a civil war. (True film, it's a vintage one, I forgot the name but it made me cringe).
