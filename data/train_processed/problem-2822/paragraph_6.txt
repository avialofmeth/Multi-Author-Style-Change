You missed the part where the FL Supreme Court rejected the DeSantis map as unconstitutional, the FL legislature passed one that the FLSC approved, then DeSantis rejected the legislature's map and submitted his own unconstitutional map again, which the legislature approved and at that point it was too late to do anything. Republican ratfuckery was on full display for everyone to see and no one could do anything about it.
