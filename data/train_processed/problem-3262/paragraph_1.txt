Superiority. Its sort if an easy button to say race is the biggest role. They also don’t want women, liberals, lgbtq, and poor white people to have a say either. The common thread is not racism, its superiority. The wealthy want to either maintain or get more power, and those in the middle don’t want to fall down the ladder and lose what little authority they think they are owed.
