Su 35 is not up to fighting anything the west would throw it’s way. They don’t really have a great path forward on jet development to get anything better. Especially when so heavily sanctioned, they kinda need the foreign currency from jet/general military junk sales to pay for upgrades and bribes. That is going to drop substantially going forward.
