A new generation of GOP voters and, more importantly, an increasing number of elected officials, arrived that were raised on Fox News (and eventually right-wing internet). The viewers went from 'useful idiots' rowing the boat to the captains behind the wheel. The 'traditional Conservatives' that never quite believed this nonsense but were happy to accept the votes (the 'adults' in the room) aged out. The old guard of Dole, Kemp, Ford, Bush Sr., George Will, Cheney, McCain had lost control of the monster, replaced by MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, Rick Scott, Trump.
