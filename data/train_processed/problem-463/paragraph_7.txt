I am a teacher and my students are coming to school hungry. In the past few months I have had to find snacks for students who were weak and shaky from not eating. Families in my schoolâ€™s attendance zone are moving to remote areas to find affordable housing. Many more families that we know need their kids to have breakfast and lunch at school.
