So if the rates have been flat and stay flat then there would be no issue on that end going forward. I’m the solution I gave, the schools could still change whatever they want. But if the government only gave a max amount like I mentioned and if private lenders didn’t stand to make as much and/or would have a massive amount of risk for a borrower defaulting, then students wouldn’t have access to as much money. Unless the students and/or parents already had money.
