My manager and professors were understanding and did their utmost to cover for a lot of absenteeism that I indulged in during my spiral, but that should never have been on them and after a while I stopped trying to communicate any of my problems. And spiraled harder. And became more absent. And had to dodge police visits to my place. And just sort of walked around for days on end not sleeping and not wanting to be at the apartment because that's where it all started. I was having at least five panic attacks a night at the beginning. The only thing that helped was just never being still or there--but you're kind of meant to be a homebody when you're on supervision or probation. I kept getting the memo and was self-destructive enough to not care whit one.
