Ehhhh. I wouldn’t count on any of that tbh. People in the US are bitching about the cost of aid, and this is during the conflict when it’s constantly on the news and when the aid is largely made in the US weapons that are killing Russians. Much harder to defend money to rebuild buildings in another country after the war is over. The EU is slow walking giving the aid they’ve committed already, and at a certain point some countries will probably start saying that giving homes to refugees was all the economic support they needed to provide or could afford. And there are lots of legal hurdles to getting the Russian money.
