My point is that his constituents are out there making an effort. I live in the district directly south of Santos’s, and I wrote to my own rep (also Republican) asking him to denounce Santos and his lies, his criminal history, and his behavior since being elected. I did not vote for him, but at least I can say my rep was an NYPD detective, so he has actually personally been affected by 9/11, or at least knows a lot of people who have. I imagine he’s not too impressed by Santos, and the people of Nassau County deserve to hear that he is against antisemitism, white supremacy, and the rest of Santos’s bullshit.
