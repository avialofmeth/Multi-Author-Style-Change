In large cities many single family homes do not have garages and they rent out to multiple tenants where street parking is the only thing available. Stringing out a charging cable across the sidewalk violates city codes. With a low adoption rate this doesnt matter so much, but with a high adoption rate, then the ADA would likely become involved, there would be numerous lawsuits.
