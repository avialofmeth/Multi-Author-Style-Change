The right to “free speech” doesn’t apply to private entities like a social media company. And even where the First Amendment does apply, the right to free speech isn’t infinite. This like claiming that a restaurant cost her the election by closing for the night and not allowing people to share their thoughts, i.e. engage in “fReE sPeACh” at the bar 24 hours a day.
