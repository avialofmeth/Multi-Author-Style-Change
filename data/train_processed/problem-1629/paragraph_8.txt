The UA has primarily been fielding Soviet/Russian assets. Both from a legacy point of view as well as repurposing abandoned Russian equipment. However, if the stories are to be even partially true, the presence of western arms in the field has been a game changer. Harpoons mounted on antiquated MiG-29, western man portable AT weapons, surveillance assets couple with western training and doctrine (and intimate institutional familiarity with Russian/Soviet doctrine) has helped stop the Russians in their tracks.
