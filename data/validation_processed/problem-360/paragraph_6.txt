The state of Mississippi is beyond despicable for their laws that have caused this to happen. The federal government should step in under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and completely redo Jackson's water infrastructure and then take the money from Mississippi's federal grants, making certain that these come from the top income earners of Mississippi, not the poor.
