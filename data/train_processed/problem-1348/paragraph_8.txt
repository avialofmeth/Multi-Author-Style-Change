The exception is at times with sensitive leaks when prosecutors go after them they make arguments about how such attacks chill the press which we rely in so heavily to inform us. In this case the fact that the recipient is publishing to many readers matters a lot and some states have actually codified that in law — commonly referred to as “the reporter’s privilege.” (Theoretically, anyone could make the same argument on First Amendment grounds without a statutory privilege, and in old days, they did. You still can).
