In recent years hospitals have been consolidated or closed because of which all responsibility for a myriad of issues keeps being shoved onto already overworked GP's (huisartsen). They often cannot in good conscience take responsibility for ever expanding clinics while not making enough money to hire more staff so they either sell their practice to insurers who fill it with freelancers or they shut down because they burn out themselves.
