You know I'm not fan of the liberal party but I have been listening to Christopher Pyne's podcast where he interviews Australian politicians from both Labor and the liberal party sometimes I don't like his guests sometimes I do ( like he had albo as a guest who I like) anyway he had Malcolm Turnbull on & Christopher Pyne said he hadn't caught a train for like 40 years until Malcolm Turnbull made him. Malcolm Turnbull said it's important to catch the train to connect with the common people and talk with them.
