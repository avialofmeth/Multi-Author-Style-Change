This finding may have resolved that dilemma. First it's evidence Homo erectus went fishing. But more even more important: wildfires typically burn at temperatures of 800 C/1470 F. The chemical structure of these fish teeth remains is evidence of a lower temperature burn, under 500 C. The chemistry probably can't pinpoint the temperatures closer than that, yet it's good enough to rule out natural causes and place this in the range of cooking temperatures. And it's near what seems to be something like a fireplace or a fire pit.
