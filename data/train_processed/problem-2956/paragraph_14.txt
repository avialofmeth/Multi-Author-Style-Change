I'm not sure how you are completely fine with this scenario, you said: "Milley was speaking off the cuff and someone at the EC likely quoted him when they shouldn't have." Thats an assumption you made right, its realistic but absolutely refuse to consider the other side of the coin that he maybe fucking misspoke and released sensitive info by mistake which is just as likely? Absurd density from you.
