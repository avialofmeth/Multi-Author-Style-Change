they don't have to because their behavior is being enabled. they know that the Federal government won't just let people freeze to death, and they also know that there will be no consequences for their actions. they can just keep taking the money and laugh all the way to the bank. the only way to break this cycle is for the leaders of texas to see consequences for their greed and negligence, but the political brainwashing is so complete that the same leaders get re-elected time and time again. so all we have left is a vicious downward spiral of greed and negligence that will never be solved by attempting to shame texan leaders on twitter. they simply are making too much money and do not have souls.
