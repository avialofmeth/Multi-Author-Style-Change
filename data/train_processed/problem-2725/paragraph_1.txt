I think the prevailing attitude is that as long as the war continues going on this way Ukraine will win. Russia gets weaker and more desperate as each day passes and as long as the west keeps up its support Ukraine will win. Russia could send their entire population to Ukraine, but they don't have the weapons or equipment to do so, which means they'd just be sending people to a firing line as long as the west keeps Ukraine armed.
