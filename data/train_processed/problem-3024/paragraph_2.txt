The reason I support returning items to the area they came from is so the descents of the local people can see the item without having to travel thousands of miles. But I think it makes sense not to have all the culturally significant items in one area because a war, an earthquake or a flood could easily destroy the items and it would be a loss to all of humanity to have items destroyed. We saw the Taliban blow up two ancient Buddhas in 2001. Turkey just had a major earthquake that killed thousands and destroyed some cultural significant structures.
