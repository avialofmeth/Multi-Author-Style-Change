That’s not what’s been written by many Indians on Reddit. It’s been “India is looking after its best interests and we have no choice but to support Russia as they supply all the fertilizer and 500 million people will starve. Also, Russia’s the only one that’s had our back all these years. Oh, and we don’t care about the plight of white people since you don’t care about brown people.” Yada, yada, yada. Not a word about giving two shits about other nations that I’ve seen.
