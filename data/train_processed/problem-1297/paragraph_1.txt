The Bolt EUV is insanely cheap for a good quality EV with 250mi of range. The slow 55kW DC Fast charging is a bit of a drawback, but it's a $28,000 EV and how often do you really need DC Fast charge? The Equinox EV coming out next year will also have 250mi range but 150kW fast charging for $30,000. I think GM might become Tesla's biggest competitor due to how low the cost of their EVs are. Demand for the Bolt is really high right now.
