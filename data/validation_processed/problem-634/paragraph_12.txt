As mentioned the GOP is still very capable of harming the country. And any young Latino (in Florida in particular) will tell you that the right's new target for propaganda and misinformation is older Latinos. But if the GOP were a stock I would short it. They decided to hit up the ATM and go all-in, and for a while it was on a roll. But they're crapping out.
