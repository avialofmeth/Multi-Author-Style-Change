Currently there are 7,6 million people living in Serbia, 1,6 in Belgrade, so those people who are supporting Russia are not majority. There were also protests in support of Ukraine, and protests against the ruling government but I guess the media don't show you that. To understand why some people support Russia, and those are usually older generations, you have to understand Serbian history. Russia has helped Serbia on many occasions when nobody else cared and some people feel obliged to do so for them. Also people did not forget the illegal NATO bombing in 1999 when many civilians where killed including children, the use of depleted uranium bombs and destruction of infrastructure that took us back a decade. I am not pro Russian or against. I am against violence, against war, against death and destruction. It is not fair to accuse the whole nation for the decisions made by their leaders that they may not have chosen. There are so many Ukrainian refugees in Belgrade today, but also Russians who fled because of the mobilisation, and we welcomed them all.
