The Japan Rail Pass was an amazing resource as a tourist. It covers local trains and shinkansen, and it paid for itself after a single trip from Fukuoka to Kyoto. I was able to see a lot of Tokyo very easily by train, and my train experience was way better than taking the buses (I'd recommend just getting a Suica transit card if you need to take the bus, I was never able to figure out the correct protocol to pay by cash without the driver getting mad at me).
