Crimea should have been treated like Kosovo. Unilateral declaration of independence if it wants, but an internationally observed referendum (not the bogus one Russia conducted) and no strong-arming by Moscow. Instead the cranky response by the West looked weak, like they didn't like it happening but weren't prepared to back a war to reverse the annexation.
