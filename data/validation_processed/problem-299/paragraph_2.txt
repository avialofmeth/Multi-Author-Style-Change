China isn't a friend to the US and would very much prefer a "multipolar" world in which there are several world powers they could play off of one another and they could have a sphere of influence in which no one else could say anything about what they're doing. You know, a cold war or age of imperialism sort of scenario, only with them on top this time. Something that approximates the way China was in any time before the 1800s.
