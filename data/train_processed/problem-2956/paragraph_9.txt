The original version of Ursula von der Leyen's address quoted "external sources" and no one at the EU has been able to confirm the "100,000 UAF killed" figure. This "external source" was very likely Milley's quote. Which is why it was so irresponsible of him to make it, even though he certainly didn't intended for it to be used that way.
