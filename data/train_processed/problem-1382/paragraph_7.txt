The murky thing here is that there are suspicions that the CIA funded the rebel groups in the first place because they wanted someone more friendly to American business interests in office. Many of the paramilitary leaders from the first coup government were able to live freely in the US after Aristide was restored to office, and years later they were able to return to Haiti with money and weapons. Aristide was a left-wing leader and a former priest in the tradition of Liberation Theology, it makes sense for the US would dislike him despite popular support in Haiti. Also, Haitian has been so fucked up from the start that despite being overthrown twice, Aristide still had one of the more successful political careers in Haitian history.
