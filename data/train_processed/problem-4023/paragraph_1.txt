It's absolutely infuriating. He invaded them. Ukrainians are defending themselves. The entire war is his doing and he can call it off whenever he wants. If Putin brought his goddamn thugs home and declared the "totally not a war you guys" operation to be concluded, Ukraine wouldn't follow them into Russia. The only person who doesn't want peace is Putin himself.
