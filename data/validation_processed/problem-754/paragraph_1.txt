Carlin's point with this story was that, if you force your men to do horrific things to the enemy and local populace, they will hate you forever, and will do the same to you if not worse if you were ever overcome by them. While I think it's definitely a scare tactic to perpetrate these horrific acts against the Iranian people, it might also be that the regime is trying to force their own enforcers into a situation where they must fight to maintain power to the bitter end. That way, those in charge either keep power, or can at least buy themselves enough time to escape.
