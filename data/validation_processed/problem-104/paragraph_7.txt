It is a fact that this shooting will not receive the same news coverage if the shooter is not a white guy. Which is still technically an if but I am highly doubtful he is since there is no mention of the race. If that fact bothers you then your anger should be with the media cooperations who make it so, not my comment on reddit pointing it out.
