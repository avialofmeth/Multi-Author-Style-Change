I'm not sure what point your trying to make here but just because their may be bad people on both sides their is only 1 country here unprovocatively massacring their neighbor country and further more is completely at fault for the missile strike in Poland. It's people like you why Russia feels that they can continue to invade,horrify and steal their neighbors land and get away with it.
