wow great summary... the post war Greece Political theater was a flying circus. you had to think during policital studies classes in school back in my youth, that "this was the place where democracy started???" (my ancient history class was before PS class) ya the ancient world was a totally different animal, but it seem like it was way better then what was going on in Greece during the 60's-80's. between the assinations, corruptions, bombings, coups.. you think there wasnt any real goverment.
