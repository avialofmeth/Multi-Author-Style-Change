Christ, the first arrest (when I wasn't a dumbshit kid, so I guess the second) ended up being for "disturbing the peace" at my own apartment. Or an "offensive gesture" depending on what their computers returned--sometimes different things came back which always made bond paperwork kind of weird. I restrained my partner when she became violent with me and threatened and tried to commit suicide in front of me and I called 911. Lesson learned I guess. She attacked the first responders too, but I guess that didn't matter.
