Second, I don't blame them for refusing Israel's terms in the past. Their idea of a "two state solution" is essentially Palestine being a vassal state with Israel having the power over the Palestinian state. Not to mention that none of the land stolen will be returned and in fact made all that land Israel is illegally sitting on officially theirs; it can't really make any agreements with other nations without Israeli approval; its military will be very limited; its borders and trade controlled by Israel; etc. etc..
