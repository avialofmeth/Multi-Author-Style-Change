Diplomats work to build trust where there is none. Surely many Russian diplomat types quietly want peace, just as those in the west must. I worry political leaders are too happy to let this war go on for ages while their arms manufacturer boosters rake in money. True for both sides. There must be diplomacy going on somewhere.
