The US isn’t some outlier in electing right wing loons into office. Brazil just finished with Jair Bolsonaro, aka Brazil’s Trump and to beat him, they needed to nominate a previous president who spent time in prison for corruption. The Philippines recently voted the Marcos family back into power even though they ran a military dictatorship and stole tax money to support a very lavish lifestyle a generation ago. And the previous guy was someone who ran on creating death squads to kill drug dealers and users without trial- and he did create the death squads and it was a popular policy. And then take a look at the new government Italy just elected.
