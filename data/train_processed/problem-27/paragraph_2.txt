For the most part, 99% of the countries of the world don't need modern equipment unless they're intending to go into a war with their neighbors. They only have to have the same level of military as their neighbors to maintain peace. If one neighboring country got more advanced weapons it'd become an arms race. It's why Pakistan and India both got nuclear weapons around the same time. Pakistan sources most of its equipment from Russia and China. India manufactures most of its equipment with permission from the country that developed it.
