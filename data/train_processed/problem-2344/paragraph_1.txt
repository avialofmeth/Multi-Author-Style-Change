I mean, yeah it seems like now you talk about adding any additional regulation at all and people kick and scream, and yet are simultaneously ok with existing regulation to bar people like felons from owning guns. Do you believe that adding any common sense regulation with empiric evidence of reduction in violence is a slight on the 2a? And if so why should felons who have served their time not be able to lawfully purchase?
