The bill won’t pass but a big issue for any criminal law is that it has to clearly define what is illegal w/ 0 room for prosecutors to use subjective interpretations to punish someone. Basically, you need to know you’re committing a crime by doing what you’re doing. The propaganda part, at least in the recounting of the article, is not defined which is concerning. Anyone who has a Blue Lives Matter patch or flag or speaks at a rally could then be charged under the act if anyone they were with were “inspired” by them. Under First Amendment protections in place, that is 100% unconstitutional and could obviously be used against BLM activists, etc. w/ some amendments. These kinds of laws should always be avoided, lest we’re one step away from full authoritarianism.
