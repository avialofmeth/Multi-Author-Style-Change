But not everything China does is about Taiwan. China's foreign policy is not just Taiwan. The over obsession is not actually very helpful or useful. I live in Australia and people ask me if I'm afraid of China because it's always in the news but honestly it's really not a very big consideration in my life or in the lives of my grandparents who still live in Taiwan. Their attitudes towards China have grown more negative in the last 10-15 years but it's not really something I nor my grandparents are particularly afraid of.
