I'm still confused by this though. So a majority of white residents in Jackson no longer are able to elect their own judges or prosecutors as well as a significant amount of black residents, totaling a bit more than 1/3rd of the city. Those residents are still paying taxes to Jackson but no longer benefitting from some of the services created by those taxes. Instead the services for this district are funded by the state.
