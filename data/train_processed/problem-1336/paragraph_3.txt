If the editors aren't being fired I'm going to assume that the reporter outright lied about his source to them to get the story published. The article mentions the last time this happened AP fired two editors along with the reporter, and that for AP the only time corroborating evidence isn't required prior to publishing is when they're using a statement from a rock solid authoritative individual. If they're following their own guidelines I'm guessing the reporter either misrepresented their source as authoritative or misrepresentation facts coming from an authoritative source, and his editors took him at his word. The editors are supposed to manage quality control, sure, but I have to imagine they operate on the assumption that their own people are working in good faith.
