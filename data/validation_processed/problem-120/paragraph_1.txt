When I was in Korea, I walked into an establishment and everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at me. The lady at the door pushed me back out the door and said no Americans I understand there are some businesses like this they just don’t want foreigners in their businesses. That’s fine it could have been for their or my safety that I was not allowed there. I don’t really care if I as a white guy am not allowed somewhere no need to get my feathers ruffled I just pretend that the place does not exist and go about my life. Why get upset because a business doesn’t want us there.
