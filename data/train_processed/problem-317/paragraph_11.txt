I think this primary will be different because of the fierce loyalty many voters have to Trump + Trump's ego. If Trump does lose a primary, he will absolutely NOT going quietly in to the night / be a gracious loser. He will begin and immediate rampage to ensure his base doesn't vote for whomever won / attempt to run 3rd party / who knows, his ego can go to some wild places when its hurt. Trump won the 2016 Primary so we didn't get to see that ego in full force. Him losing a primary will be a whooooooole different ball game.
