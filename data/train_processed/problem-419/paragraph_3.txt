For instance, there was a brief time when only Russia had Passenger Jetplanes. Why? Because early Jet engines were dangerous, and the west grounded theirs till they were made safe. Meanwhile the Russians kept flying theirs. Which crashed at a truly alarming rate. (The Russian jets were truly terrible designs, that had been rushed for the propaganda).
