The point for something like the 10RC is for a platform with a cannon that is more than enough to punch through T-72s and T-64s in Russian service, and be far more mobile to use in flanking or ambush roles. The latter of which is something that they may be expecting to need given the anticipation of a Russian offensive following the Winter.
