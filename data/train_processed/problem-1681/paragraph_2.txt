There are over a thousand moai on Easter Island as well as many, many unfinished ones. Many more are buried. It's interesting because people think there are only a handful but there are tons of them, they're everywhere. What blew me away was finding out that to transport them they likely "walked" them rocking side to side as they "walked" across the island. Apparently it wasn't a very safe method as the island is littered with broken moai along their transport routes.
