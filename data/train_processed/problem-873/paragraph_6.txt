Russia absolutely SHOULD withdraw, but too many Russian officials are afraid of looking weak. Putin and his cronies now may realize that invading Ukraine was a mistake, but by cutting their losses, they admit they failed to achieve their goal, and Russian culture is so “toxically masculine” that failure is seen as worse than starting a war for no good reason and committing mass murder.
