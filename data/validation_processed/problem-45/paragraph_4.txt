I predict that once he formally announces he's gonna have a rough time since the knives from Trumpland will be out. Desantis isn't going to be able to acquit himself well enough on Fox News explaining why whatever Trump is ranting about isn't actually correct. He's currently having the same kind of polling boom that Giuliani and Fred Thompson had in 2007 and Scott Walker had in 2015. The media assumes they're the guy and voters project what they want on to them. Then once they start actually having to campaign and hit the circuit it's underwhelming and everyone realizes they're boring.
