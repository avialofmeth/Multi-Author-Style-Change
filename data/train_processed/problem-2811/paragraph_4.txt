There's conservatives watching their engagement drop on Twitter and now think Elon is still allowing censorship. Joke's on them, the real problem is Twitter is dying. I open Twitter and I don't see posts from people I follow, and instead a bunch of right-wing ding-dongs I don't follow, complaining they're being silenced.
