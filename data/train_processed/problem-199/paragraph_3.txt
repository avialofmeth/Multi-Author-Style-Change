Given the extensive peer-reviewed evidence that progressives underperform in general elections (e.g., see the prior literature section of ), running moderates in purple districts and progressives in deep blue districts seems like a pretty smart evidence-based strategy. I would want a party leader who is objective about the evidence rather than wishful thinking of pushing one faction independent of the realities of different districts.
