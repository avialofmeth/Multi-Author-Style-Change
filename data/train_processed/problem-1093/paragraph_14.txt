Trump lost due to his own actions plain and simple; just like Hillary's clear corruption in the runup to the election caused just enough democrats in the right swing states to not vote, the same thing happened to Trump during his reelection. It doesn't matter how many votes he got, they weren't in the right states that mattered, again thanks to Trump's stupid twitter comments!
