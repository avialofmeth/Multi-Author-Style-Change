Tucker Carlson's only ideal of America is a cult of self-proclaimed superiority in which a designated in-group, that he considers himself a part of, is in charge. He evidently does not see conventional American politics, whether lib or con, as advancing this ideal in the slightest. But he looks at someone like Putin as a person who advances that goal for his nation actively. Which is why he is a Putin sympathiser but cannot root for his own president regardless of faction.
