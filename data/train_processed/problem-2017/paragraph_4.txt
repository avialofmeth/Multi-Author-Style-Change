In terms of the unleaded in our mowers, I think it would just be a pain to get started, run poorly or not at all. It would also be a pain if you have to drain the tank as it means finding somewhere to dispose of the old fuel. We can use an alternative branded unleaded fuel called Aspen which supposedly lasts longer than normal unleaded. However it's a lot more expensive and some people (myself included) complain it gives them a headache.
