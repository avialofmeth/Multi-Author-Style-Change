Before those religions existed, there were normal people who didn't kill each other and murderers, that were cast out of society. With those books, people assume that only the book made them not murder each other. There's no benefit to it. But we DID see the powerful religious leaders abuse the power to kill people. Look how even today people are executed in iran and call it a net neutral.
