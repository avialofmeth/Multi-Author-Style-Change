So you are saying liberals didn’t support globalization? Pretty sure the liberal darling Bill Clinton help push NAFTA through. Personally I believe republicans in the 80s created the mess we are all in but it was a collective effort led by the ruling elites and corporations to boost profits. When good got cheap Americans gobbled them up while their neighbors in the rust belt begged for jobs. We all share in this to an extent. I blame the politicians the most and the CEO’s but that doesn’t absolve my greedy ass either.
