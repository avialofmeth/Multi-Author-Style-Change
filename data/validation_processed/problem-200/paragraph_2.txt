If you're suggesting the bribed the ref, Saudi Arabia got 6 yellow cards during that match lmao. Ref was handing them out like candy to Saudi. The fact of the matter is, Argentina became over confident after half time and Saudi's very risky offside trap paid off. They simply put performed them in the 2nd half.
