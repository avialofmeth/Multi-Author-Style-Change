What Netanyahu is doing is what many Republicans want vis-a-vis Trump. We can expect Biden to continue avoiding the topic altogether until after November '24. This gives Israel's right wing ample time to destroy it's democracy and create a regime that can withstand a pivot away from the United States. This is really a story about America's Republican Party, because they are the only group that actually helps Israel meaningfully. If it dies in 2024, Israel must either become a secular multi-ethnic democracy or a fascist one-party state similar to Francoist Spain. Which is an apt comparison as both countries sit on opposite sides of the Mediterranean.
