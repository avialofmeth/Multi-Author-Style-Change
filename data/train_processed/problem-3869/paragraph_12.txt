Saskatchewan made a law that you couldn't protest on hospital or school property and for a certain distance around the property (union demonstrations were exempt.). They did this because protesters were obstructing staff/students/parents/patients from going in and out of the buildings. It was ridiculous. They were putting up fences, and not allowing school buses and ambulances to drive up. They put concrete barriers up at night. It was a big cost to remove this stuff every morning. There would be angry signs near the Cancer Center entrances. Nobody wants to see that when they are going for chemotherapy.
