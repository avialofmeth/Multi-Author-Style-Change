I've been saying for a while now: 0.05xn! in which x is their yearly revenue and n is a running count of every fine they receive. First fine, 5% of yearly revenue. Third fine 30%. Fourth 120%. Fifth fine is 6x what they bring in a year. Knock 1 off of n every 50-100 years to account for changes in management due to various reasons like deaths or resignations.
