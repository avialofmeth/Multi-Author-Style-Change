As an AZ resident my opinion is that these right wing voters can’t understand that with 1/3 of us democrats and another 1/3 independents we aren’t in lockstep with them. The reason you know independents are voting for democrats is the republican state treasurer won by a landslide. That means democrats were voting for her too. It’s basically metro Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff, with the majority of the population, that’s keeping us save from these nut jobs. Here’s a funny side note. My local democratic district didn’t have Katy Hobbs on its recommendation list. Most everyone wanted Mays to run for governor. And Hobbs still beat Lake.
