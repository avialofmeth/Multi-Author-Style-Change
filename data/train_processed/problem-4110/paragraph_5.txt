>Furthermore, it's worth noting that in some cases, discrimination based on caste or other social hierarchies can be perpetuated by the very fact of being in a new country. For instance, if a person who holds a lower caste status in their home country moves to the United States and experiences discrimination from members of their own community who hold a higher caste status, this can be a form of discrimination that is linked to their national origin, and is thus prohibited by U.S. law.
