If DeSantis doesn't carry Florida next week with a mandate, he is done. He's evaluation isn't Ohio, it's how he can command THE swing state of all swing states. If it's even close, Trump can hammer that home to everyone that matters to DeSantis in a single social media post. Trump can't share the GOP at all. It's most of his active revenue streams and the key to staying free and rich. DeSantis is a far bigger threat to Trump than any Democrat, DA, or court.
