I used to care about buying local,now I don't care at all. Why? Because I've learned that almost all business owners around me are scumbags like everyone else. I learned most of the farms near me hire immigrants so that they can pay the bare minimum while getting the most work out of them legally possible. Now I just buy the produce/ food that has the least amount of plastic packaging, whether it's local or not.
