This legal “theory” and I use the term loosely would bar state courts from stopping the state legislators from passing unconstitutional state laws which go against state constitutions regarding election laws. I can’t believe that this is being brought to the Supreme Court, because the theory has no legal weight to justify its presentation to the Supreme Court especially since North Carolina wants to argue that they can be trusted in self enforcing the elections and super promise not to be bigoted in passing election laws which would violate minority rights and deny them their rights to vote. Smh.
