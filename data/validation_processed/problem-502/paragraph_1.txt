Our border with Russia is 1344 km long, which makes this issue quite difficult. The war is of course possible. On the other hand Finland and Russia have such a long tradition of "friendship" policy, that it might help even in this situation right now, when the Russian-Finnish relationship is freezingly cold. It is really at the lowest level since 1920's. That's like a total U-turn compared to previous. But still the history of our relationship might help us to prevent the war.
