Trump himself is expected to face criminal referrals, reportedly for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, and insurrection. Referrals are also expected for other Trump allies, including Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has suggested referrals for ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations may also be issued. However, the Committee's referrals are non-binding and it will be up to federal prosecutors to bring charges.
