One of the primary reasons that the US and allies beat the ever living shit out of Iraq in the Gulf War back in the early 90s was because US armored vehicles were by and large equipped with more modern sensor and communications packages. This is still true today, at the moment both Ukraine and Russia lack modern sensor packages on most of their tanks. See first, shoot first, kill first.
