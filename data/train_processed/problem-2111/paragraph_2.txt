And Venezuelans and Cubans and more. Many south and Central American countries have toyed with socialism, to varying degrees of success (to put it lightly), which means you come across a lot of Floridians who fled those places in search of a better life. Some found it in the US. Of course this is a bit of a self selection process since youâ€™re not talking to the many people who chose to stay behind, but it is very much a thing. I neither mean that as an endorsement of socialism or the American capitalist system.
