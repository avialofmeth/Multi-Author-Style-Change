One of Ukraine's strategies this whole conflict has been to make Russia pay for every bit of ground taken. Attacking traditionally spends many more resources than defending. Last I saw, Bakhmut was pretty much leveled, so I doubt Ukraine is holding it just to hold it. This is what the north looked like right before Ukraine's main counter-offensive took back a huge chunk of land.
