Karma is a beach. Now let them feel how Armenians always felt when they had to leave Armenia to Russia because most if them got tired of endless wars. I hope they learn their lesson in Armenia how Russia divided Armenian lands and put Armenia in a position to always fight for survival so they can sell weapons and act like peacekeepers same time on the world stage.
