Not only is this attempting to create a tyranny of the majority (51% able to take away the rights of the 49%--sorry mate, majority rule is not called democracy), not only will this make Israel not a democracy anymore akin to Syria or Egypt, it will also lay all foundations necessary for a government to turn into a dictatorship if they so wish. In a western democracy, it is all but impossible for a democracy to undo itself short of a coup, but the reform proposed will turn it into a matter of legality.
