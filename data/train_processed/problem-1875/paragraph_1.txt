This is exactly what happened, and probably the reason for his announcement. The EU let Hungary know that the expected decision to release the so far blocked cohesion funds on December 5 is now postponed to next year. It is generally assumed that Orb√°n is using his vote in the NATO expansion as a bargaining chip. Trying to strenhen his hand for next year, or just tit for tat "if you delay ill delay too" is the most plausible explanation.
