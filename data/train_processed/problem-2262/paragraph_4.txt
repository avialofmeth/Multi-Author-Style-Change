I was in the committee room in Tennessee when Rep. Bulso (R), Brentwood, told a trans teen that they were "a fiction, a fantasy." After the teen bared their soul about transitioning and what it took. This was testimony on a bill that would have kept that teen from living their life and getting the gender-affirming care they needed. HB1 now sits on the governor's desk waiting his signature. When signed that teen would have to detransition by March 1, 2024 if they didn't hit 18 by then.
