The source is Newsweek...for half a century, Newsweek was owned by the Washinon Post and was a well-respected voice in American journalism. In 2010, the Post sold Newsweek to 91-year-old businessman Sidney Harman. Ownership turned over a few more times, a shell of its former self. All that was left was clickbait, op-eds from the likes of Nigel Farage and Newt Gingrich, and a general sense of drift, basically “a zombie magazine.” Sad.
