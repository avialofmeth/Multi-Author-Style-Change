That being said, regarding the topic: yeah, most people here are against the world cup, with a lot of people not watching it (example: me), because of the human rights situation, FIFA's greed and for the largest part (personal opinion) because of the insanity to play a football worldcup in a desert country that has no proper attachement to the sport.
