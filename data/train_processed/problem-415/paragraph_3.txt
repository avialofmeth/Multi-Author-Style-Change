Honestly I expect that to be what happens here. Russia is unlikely to be able to hold any terrify in the face of Ukraine attacks, but Ukraine won't attack Russia. Since Russia has nothing to gain from surrendering they won't, just continue to claim the land is theirs while being unable to do anything about it.
