Putin might be seeking leverage for a diplomatic solution, such as restoring Crimea to Russia and promising that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO. But it's hard to imagine Putin and hardliners in Russia accepting such a compromise even if it was offered. It seems more likely to me that Putin is just stalling for time, and has no idea how to win this war or get out of it with his power intact at home. He is well and truly stuck.
