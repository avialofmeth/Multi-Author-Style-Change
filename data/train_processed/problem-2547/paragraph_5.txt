So why are the families suing the manufacturer over the criminal actions of a third party (who didn't even buy the guns in the first place)? What other products do we allow that for? Do we allow families to sue AB InBev and Ford for the criminal misuse of their products by a drunk driver? Did anyone sue Home Depot and the truck manufacturer for their actions in the 2017 NYC truck attack? Did anyone sue ? ? ?
