Like, I understand people who bag on addicts. I don't condone it, I don't apologize for it, but I understand where it comes from. Some people don't understand things until they experience something like it themselves, like I didn't quite understand how one could have limited range of motion in a joint until I experienced it myself. So I can understand how profound ignorance can lead people to misunderstand something like addiction, but where does one get off on hating the family that wants someone to do better?
