There's different kinds of fake. These were presumed to me be modern fakes trying to pass as ancient coins, not fake ancient coins trying to pass as real ancient coins. Basically this proves they're likely not a hoax, and that they were in use, however briefly, in ancient times. That use could have included faking a different ancient coin, but I'm not sure how widespread that practice was and whether it really disproves the existence of the guy whose face was on the coins. After all, finding a fake pound with the picture of the Queen on it doesnt disprove the existence of the Queen, quite the opposite.
