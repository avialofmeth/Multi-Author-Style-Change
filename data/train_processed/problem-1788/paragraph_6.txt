Itâ€™s part of why Appalachia kept voting blue for a few decades after the Democratic Party turned left. And New England was electing Republicans until recently. The shift in the 2000s was not just because of stances. FDR Democrats and Eisenhower Republicans were gradually dying off. My grandma (96) is a rural white churchgoing lady. She votes reliably Democratic simply because she always has, since 1944, even if Republicans now better fit her mores. Old habits die hard and sometimes not at all.
