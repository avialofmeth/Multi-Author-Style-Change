The funny thing is, the vast majority of them are extremely positive, optimistic, and grateful to be alive. There are varying degrees of cognitive disability among the group -- some are frozen in time at the age they had their accident, some regressed to childhood, and some are essentially unchanged -- but it's also coupled with various degrees of physical disability. One guy is essentially a terminator. He's made almost entirely of titanium and carbon fiber, has one eye, and a tendency to get super emotional about his life. But he also walks, very slowly and unsteadily, with a walker. Others are in wheelchairs. One of my clients lost his senses of sight and smell and is otherwise basically unchanged.
