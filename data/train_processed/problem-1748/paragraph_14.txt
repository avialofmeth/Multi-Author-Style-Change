Except as we saw last year, it can backfire pretty spectacularly when you put your foot into international business yourself, where any sign of weakness (such as not taking Ukraine in 3 days like planned) opens you up to all these other western countries you've spent a decade or more messing with finally seeing an opportunity to knock you down a size. I doubt the UK for example would be as gung-ho in regards to weapons shipments to Ukraine if Russia hadn't been poisoning their citizens in botched assassination attempts, or meddling in their politics.
