I know a guy who wanted to be an IT guy at his country's national bank. He was obsessed with getting the latest certs, anticipating that they may be running on cutting edge tech that he is not familiar. He got the job aaaand same thing as you said, hundreds of billions runs through there...on 25 year old systems.
