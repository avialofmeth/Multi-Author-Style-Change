I grew up in a small town in PA and that's been the case there as well. Every year the candidates that promise to cut taxes are the ones that win and every year there's a new service being cut or downgraded that everyone gets upset about. And yet the next year the same thing plays out. In the past 5 years they've cut the recycling program (and there's a limit to how many cans of garbage you can put out so people stopped getting all their garbage collected once recycling was included), they stopped expanding sewer and public water lines even though more and more places have been dealing with septic and well issues, and recently they've stopped school bus services which has forced some parents to drive their kids over 30 minutes to school. But of course next election cycle they'll vote against whichever candidate calls for bringing back some of these things because it would mean higher taxes even though no new businesses will touch the area with a 10 mile pole.
