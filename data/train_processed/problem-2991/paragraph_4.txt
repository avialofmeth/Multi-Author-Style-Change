The Republican Party seems to be trying to slot DeSantis in as a replacement for Trump so they could continue their tax-cut/austerity/deregulation policies. Honestly, I think most of the Republican voting base could accept it, but the donor class might not like how he enacted a personal vendetta against the Disney corporation and Disney World.
