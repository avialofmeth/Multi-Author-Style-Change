T-72’s also have gun stabilizers, although I doubt their fire control systems are on par with the M1. I’ve heard the Iraqi’s dug out their positions to have their tanks sit hull down with only the turret exposed, but rendered them completely stationary and the coalition forces were easily able to pick off the stationary targets. Not to mention the Iraqis had older model T-72b’s likely without any ERA protection that more modern Russian variants typically have.
