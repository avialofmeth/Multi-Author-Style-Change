Kotek is notable in that she has at least argued for housing and getting people in houses. I don't think she'll actually manage to address the sheer scale of the problem (at least not without the legislature), and she could have broader support for it, but at least she has argued for the basic idea - and this is a reasonable step in regards to executive authority.
