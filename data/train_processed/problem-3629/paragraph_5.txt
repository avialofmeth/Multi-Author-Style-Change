In the past and present you do though like the holodomor, the Uyghur genocide, etc. The list just goes on and ones ranging from theocracies to utopian idealists. The reality is we don't have enough resources on this planet and have extreme levels of inequality and have had constant violence. Most people just want to live decent lives and try to build a better future for there children. Not have to deal with any extremists trying to force everyone to have to live a certain way so in that way I find it hard to compare any ideology to terrorism unless there is a correlation with all of them.
