Satellites can only spend a couple of minutes over a target because they're moving at 17,500mph, and they're generally hundreds of miles up at least in order to avoid the worst of atmospheric drag. The truss and boom on this balloon was larger than anything in orbit except ISS, and being at 12 miles altitude while moving at a couple hundred miles an hour means it could stay over a target area for an hour or more and gather a whole lot more intel than any spy satellite.
