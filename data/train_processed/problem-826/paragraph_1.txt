This has happened many times throughout history, you should know. It's common, they're often called Conversos. Such people are always welcome back in the Tribe if you ever so wish, but they must renounce Christianity. If they're willing to do that they can be 100% Jewish and of the Tribe again, even if they're not strictly Jewish religiously observant - being in the Tribe is your Birthright if you want it, the only disqualification is following another religion especially Christianity, though again you don't necessarily have to be religiously Jewish because we're first and foremost a people, an ancient tribe. You'd be a baal teshuvah (a Master of Return/Repair) and welcomed with open arms.
