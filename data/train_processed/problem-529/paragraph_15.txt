He's going to tell the family and the kid that the best chance is to try to negotiate a plea for minimal punishment and commitment to a inpatient psychiatric facility. They'll say that sucks, but it makes sense, I mean, he did do it right? And he's going to go and talk to the prosecutor. They'll haggle and the public defender will come back and say hey I got you a pretty good deal, you'll do at least 30 days in Juvenile detention but after that you can get out once there's a bed in a residential facility available. Then you'll go there, and you'll probably stay there for 6 months. But you're going to be on probation for 5 years, and if you violate the probation you'll probably go to jail.
