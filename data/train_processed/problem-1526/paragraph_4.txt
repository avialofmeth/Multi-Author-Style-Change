Depends on whether it's the book or not (unlike the film, the book has Rambo as a psychopath who murders possibly dozens of people just doing their jobs, Teasle - I don't remember him as any kind of bigot - originally moved him out of town because he correctly picked Rambo was trouble - I don't remember in the book that a friend lived there - it was the town where Rambo finally snapped and came back after being moved on unlike the previous towns - and Trautman had to be brought him in to put him down like a rabid dog after Rambo basically burned it down and killed numerous police officers - pre novel retcon, his last words about Rambo to a mortally wounded Teasle was something like "and that's why I blew his head off with this shotgun.").
