Knowing Russians and their cynical mentality, I wouldn’t put it like you do. Yes, maybe in Syria (I have limited knowledge of that)—but anything you ever ever do to a Russian to attempt to show your pure intentions/innocence/nonpartisanship has the polar opposite effect. Always. They’re suspicious, paranoid, cynical. They think that if a car attempts to look humanitarian, then it MUST DEFINITELY not be that.
