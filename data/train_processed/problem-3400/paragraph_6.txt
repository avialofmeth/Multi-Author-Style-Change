Frankly, Hochul has always been somewhatâ€¦ suspicious. She was endorsed by the NRA, for example - which is very strange for a democrat. During covid, she made enemies in the state because she was trying to basicaly force everything back open ASAP and telling people it was time to stop working from home, because their commute fueled the economy. She also was involved in a retaliatory firing where someone at an organization within the state tried to whistleblow a suspicious deal, so they were fired.
