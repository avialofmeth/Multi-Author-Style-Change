By this I mean how Canada, the USA and Australia have institutions that found their beginnings in Enlightenment thinking. Stuff like separation of powers, parliaments and connections to the British monarchy (in Aus and Canada's cases), representative democracy, capitalism and so on. This is contrast to the systems of governments set up by indigenous people which tended to be more in line with what we would now call socialism (although that's a whole can of worms).
