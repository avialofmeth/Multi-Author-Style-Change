Yeah I've started quietly doing this again as well. It's not really out of fear of catching the virus, more that I absolutely have not forgotten how my fellow citizens behaved at the beginning of covid with regards to panic buying. I'm planning on having maybe a month or two's worth of stuff to weather the initial storm. Had a very bad feeling twice in the past 5 years - one in December 2019 when I saw whisperings online about some sort of virus in China, and one in December 2021 when I saw videos of Russian APCs with parachutes attached being mobilised in Belgorod. I've got that same feeling again reading current developments around bird flu.
