Agreed i mean i think that democrats have at least an acceptable quality of candidates. What are you suggesting they actually do to stop this illegitimate republican party. I mean i hope many of that actual criminal elements get some kind of indictment or prosecution soon but other than that what are the democrats supposed to do. Republicans just project all their shitty behavior onto the dems and make the country believe that democrats are lying cheating stealing and the masses slop it up and their seems to be very little trust in the party. I dont think that opinion will change anytime soon as long as republicans obstruct and then blame dems for short comings that GOP helps create. What do you suggest they do? How do you fight a grease fire with water?
