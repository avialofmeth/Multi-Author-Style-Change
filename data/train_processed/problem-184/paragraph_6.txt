At some point I realized if the Republicans are lying about LGBT issues. What else do they just lie about and I researched their lies on Abortion, Immigration and more. It was then I decided that anything a Republican said or did had to be looked at very closely because it was usually against the ideals of our democracy. This all led to me becoming a democrat and an atheist.
