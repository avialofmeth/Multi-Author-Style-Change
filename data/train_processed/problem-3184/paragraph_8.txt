At the heart of all this is a fiscal win to loss ratio that keeps the war momentum easily going in NATO's favor and without a bunch of pushback from each country. In hindsight the NATO prep of Ukraine even if they weren't in NATO yet should have been much larger since 2014 and they would already have had a big NATO stockpiles of gear to train and start the offensive with. Having to do the gear transition during an active invasion SUCKS, but a careful deployment of gear to avoid loss and give training is probably just the smart/high probability approach.
