Things were the best they had ever been in human history. Even things falling off for a few years still puts us in an amazing place. No famines, a reasonable effective response to a plague, a good job market with historically competitive pay... Yeah, there's a hell of a lot wrong, but a lot of it was always wrong but we simply had bigger fish to fry. Now that we fixed most of the easy stuff we're left with the stuff that's really hard and to fix.
