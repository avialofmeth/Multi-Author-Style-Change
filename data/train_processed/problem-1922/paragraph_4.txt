May be true, but there's still many in these countries that are sadly lumped in with their government's way of thinking. Like when Trump was running the US, he did not at all, speak for me on any of my beliefs. I expect that for many Russians, Chinese, and even Middle Easterners. If the world could simply be peaceful without crazy-ass leadership, I feel like many would prefer it.
