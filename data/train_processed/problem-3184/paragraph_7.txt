MAYBE you would, but what if you didn't. More complex units are the hardest to produce, to stockpile, to maintain and replace. The war effort might be hurt more for losing expensive units up front that it didn't have to lose without a huge benefit. Jet fighters are not the easiest or best weapon for defense and priority has been just getting them switched over to NATO supplies of core defense staples like basic weapons and gear, artillery, SAMS, troop/gear transport and now tanks. You can see how fighter jets that need airports might make more sense coming last in that chain.
