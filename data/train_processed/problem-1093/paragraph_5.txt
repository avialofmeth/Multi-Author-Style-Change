And there's a reason why Trump lost his reelection, because he had simply pissed off just enough of his own base from key battleground states to lose them and Trump just thought they'd all vote like they had the first time!? Trump got a taste of the problem Hillary had; voters were either diehard fans or apathetic and angry at Trump's antic's. His whole stop the steal bluster is Autocracy101 in the making right there and turned off even more people that were not diehard supporters. Trump himself says he looks up to people like Putin, thank the celestial teapot that Trump did not actually rig the election beforehand because that smug fuck thought that he'd already won.
