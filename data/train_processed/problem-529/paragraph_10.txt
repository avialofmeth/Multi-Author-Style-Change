Because this is an upper middle class family that is responsible and presents a compelling picture, the prosecutor is far more inclined to believe them. He's got a victim that is asking him not to file charges and a plan to fix the problem and He won't question too hard when the family says the child is "troubled" (as opposed to being a criminal) and agree that if the plan is followed they won't file charges. The file goes to the bottom of the stack and only gets pulled out if the kid gets arrested again.
