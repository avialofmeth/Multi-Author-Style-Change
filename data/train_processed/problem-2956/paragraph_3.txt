Russia has a new general. Hes much more competent than the previous one and hes more defensive minded and his plan seems to be to drag this into a long one. This war needs to end soon for Ukraine to have a stable future(Thats why U.S was/is publicly urging for Ukraine to broker a peace with the invaders) but the longer this drags on the better it is for Russia for numerous reasons.
