Similarly, if a bakery doesn't want to bake a wedding cake for a LGTBQ+ couple then they shouldn't be sued into doing so. I wouldn't want them spitting in the cake batter personally... Just move on to the next bakery that will do it and leave a negative Yelp review or whatever for the other business.
