Only Indian nationalistic dumbasses think Russia will any longer come to the aid of India in a Sino-Indian conflict. And only western simpleminded blabbermouths would be sure that Russia would ever give up its strategic relations with both countries to try and intervene militarily. Also, both India and China have made it clear that what happens between them, remains between them. At best they'll try to slink in diplomatic support, but nothing more.
