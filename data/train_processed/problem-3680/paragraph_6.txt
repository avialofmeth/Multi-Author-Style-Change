If the loot is destroyed or taken back by the enemy that really demotivates/demoralizes them. It’s like they irretrievably lost their paychecks. They know they aren’t fighting nazis, nato, or defending Russia so they’re fighting because they were told to and fighting for loot. Now half the motivation is gone. I imagine seeing your equipment is poor, it’s cold and miserable, everything is dangerous, but thinking “At least I have my loot” would help cope. Now there’s less coping material.
