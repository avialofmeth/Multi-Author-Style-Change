I’m Russian and I grew up in a small city near 6k people and one of my former classmates and another guy my age (23) from the city died in Ukraine. And I’m not that socialised (working from home since 19) and don’t have many acquaintances. So I imagine a lot of people in Russia have their friends or acquaintances died in Ukraine… But to your point, their bodies were recovered and sent home, but it took more than a month….
