And the fact that he was a former US soldier, in an rather adversary country to the US, wouldn’t of influenced the trial or the sentence? I’m not saying he’s innocent, I’m saying that I don’t trust Russian courts to do a trial against an American fairly, nor do I trust Russian jails to treat Americans fairly. Until just last year, he was stuck in what was essentially a penal colony and that’s not a situation I would want for any American (including those stuck in our domestic prison slavery).
