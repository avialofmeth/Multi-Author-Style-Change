Yeah, but the point is that they did not condemn the fact, that Stalin used the hunger to eradicate Ukrainian culture and nationalism, by selling most of the ukranian grain to the world market and forbidding anyone to leave the Ukranian Soviet Republic. There were several policies that targeted ethnical Ukranians, which resulted in them being much more affected by hunger death than ethnical Russians inside Ukraine. It was genocide.
