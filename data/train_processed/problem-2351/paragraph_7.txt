There's a huge difference between visa-free access and Schengen. With Schengen you basically have no hard border, anyone can cross anytime with ease, and any checks in importing/exporting, visas, or identity to enter the area need to be done by the country a person or shipment of goods enter the Schengen area through. The whole area is therefore subject to the standards of the weakest version in the agreement, and it will take a long time before Ukraine can demonstrate their up to the standard the other countries in the agreement will accept.
