The “just asking questions” thing was really popular with Nazis and Fascists. The idea as they used is to let your audience answer the questions for you. They don’t need to vocalize it, just answer it in their head. Later, the speaker supplies the answer, and the audience feels like they have an intellectual connection with the speaker. Because people tend to determine intelligence by how much someone agrees with them, the speaker has instantly become a smart person too.
