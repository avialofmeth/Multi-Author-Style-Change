This individual didn’t speak too highly of Trump’s policies even though this person leaned to the right politically. The area they were in charge of didn’t command too much attention from the White House so this person come in, did their job to the best of their ability and left at the end of the administration. This person has stepped out of the limelight unlike their predecessors who wrote in opposition or in support of policies of the current Administration, so I’m not sure if serving as a political appointee will rank highly on their resume.
