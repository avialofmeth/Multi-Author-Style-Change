100%. I was dating an Italian woman at the time while he and Obama were in office and reflected that Italy needed to move forward and away from the past, like Berlusconi should be (at that time). I was excited at the prospect of an economist like Monti or Draghi leading the country. Berlusconi made a joke of the country during his time from the outside looking in. I ate my words not a few years later... Trump is 100% our Berlusconi. The fact Berlusconi came back after all the bullshit over the years... red flags indeed.
