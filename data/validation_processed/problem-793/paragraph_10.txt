That would not be entrapment either. The state will successfully argue that you were willing to sell drugs just fine. A law abiding citizen would decline. The police can give you the opportunity and even the tools to commit a crime without a problem. Entrapment is concerned with the state corrupting you to commit a crime you wouldn't otherwise have commited.
