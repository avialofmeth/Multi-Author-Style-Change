It is not clear that Whelan is wrongfully detained. He has a history of convicted theft in the Marines, for which he was dishonorably discharged. He has a history of documented lying about his employment and education. He had $80,000 in cash which was clearly for some illegal "off the books" activity. Nothing a legit businessperson would have other than for bribes. He has boasted of "friends" in the Russian FSB. That "friend" is who arrested him in his hotel room with the $80k in cash.
