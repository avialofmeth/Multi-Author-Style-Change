"YOU JUST STAND RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THIS BACKPACK WITH WIRES AND FLASHING LIGHTS. WE'RE GONNA GO STAND BACK 5 OR 10 BLOCKS. JUST STAY THERE. OH YEAH. DON'T USE YOUR RADIO OR YOUR CELLPHONE UNTIL WE CALL YOU OVER YOUR RADIO OR ON YOUR CELLPHONE. IF YOU HEAR SUSTAINED BEEPING FROM THE BACKPACK KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE. (YOINKS!)".
