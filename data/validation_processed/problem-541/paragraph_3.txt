Yeah pretty much everyone on the planet is threatened by this problem - corrupt, incompetent, fascist-adjacent authoritarians with fragile egos that stoke ethnoreligious tensions, homophobia/transphobia/misogyny and/or ultranationalism in order to cling to power and run their countries into the ground. In places such people havenâ€™t taken control yet, there are powerful movements that seek to install them into government.
