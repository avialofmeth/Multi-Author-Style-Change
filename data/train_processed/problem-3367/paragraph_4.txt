This is the chief thing I’ve never understood about Walmart constantly depressing the wages of their workers. If they paid more then they’d just make more sales. Virtually nobody who works for Walmart is doing so well that they’d start investing in stocks, and they’re not going to shop anywhere else because they get that employee discount.
