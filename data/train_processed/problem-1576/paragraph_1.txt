I mean as an Indian we remember quite well when the US not only appeased but actively supported the second largest genocide since WW2 and threatened us with war when we tried to intervene against said genocide. The only reason we did manage to intervene against the genocide was because the Soviets said they'd have our backs if the US intervened.
