Uh, stuff that's on the list of things we can shrug off with "sometimes we do stupid things" is stuff like forgetting to move clothes from the wash to the dryer or to get eggs from the grocery store. Intentionally lying to voters about an unbelievably high number of things about yourself and your credentials isn't one of them.
