The US is the one criticizing China here. So it's fair to examine the US in a similar context. An equivalent of what's happening here would be Russia/China/Iran criticizing human rights violations in a country, someone criticizing R/C/I for the hypocrisy and then someone saying ah the classic 'BUT THE R/C/I' deflection.
