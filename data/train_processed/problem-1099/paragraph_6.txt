The West Bank is in danger of becoming ungovernable - especially once Abbas goes. I don't know who his successor would even be, but the Jenin raid was into territory the PA should be policing, but doesn't because it would weaken its support further... and with the PA suspending security co-operation, that's an intelligence stream gone that makes it harder for Israel to prevent attacks.
