I think it’s mainly because Ukraine isn’t really attacking much inside Russian airspace, they’re trying to take back what Russia has stolen. That was one of the main issues as to why the US and others were concerned with supplying long range artillery which would undoubtedly escalate the war. But at this time I think it’s safe to say Russia is fair game after they’ve continuously hit civilian infrastructure.
