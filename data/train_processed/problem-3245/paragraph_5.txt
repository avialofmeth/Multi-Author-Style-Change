So Republican politicians offer nothing but grievance because that's what their voters want. Republican voters know their politicians are all on the take and corrupt as hell but they don't care as long as minorities are being hurt. Some of them believe that will make everything better and the rest want to hurt those they hate. Nothing else matters because there isn't anything else to them.
