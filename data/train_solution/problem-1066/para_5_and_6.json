    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit a direct and somewhat informal tone with a focus on conveying information. Paragraph 1 uses more colloquial language and includes slang ('bullshit'), whereas paragraph 2 is more formal due to its automated response nature.",

    },
    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 has longer, complex sentences with varying structures, while paragraph 2 consists of shorter, straightforward sentences typical of automated responses. The cohesion and coherence are different due to the nature of the content.",

    },
    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 exhibits a negative, critical tone with strong emotions, while paragraph 2 maintains a neutral, informative tone consistent with automated messages. The narrative styles and expressions differ significantly.",
