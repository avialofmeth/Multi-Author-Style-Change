Today it was mostly quiet, but there were a couple of missile launches from Belgorod around 4pm, they weren’t aimed at Kharkiv, but at Kupiansk, or at least in its direction. We don’t know where it landed exactly, and there were no reports of explosions from anywhere, but Kupiansk has been getting hit regularly after it was liberated, it is being both shelled and hit with missiles.
