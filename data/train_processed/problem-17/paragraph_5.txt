The Orthodox Church of Ukraine was formed out of a unification of three different churches, including parts of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate that no longer wanted to be subservient to Moscow. This broad representation was why they were granted autocephalous status by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and recognized by other (non-Moscow-controlled) Orthodox churches.
