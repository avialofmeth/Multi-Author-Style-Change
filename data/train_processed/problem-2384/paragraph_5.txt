I DO believe that sex work is work, legalization of drugs, overhauling our justice system starting with prisons and courts. As a disabled afghan veteran I just want to be left alone. I don’t fit into your view of society and I don’t want to, and I know of a lot of others that are just like me. But dems are just as bad about stomping out my beliefs as the republicans.
