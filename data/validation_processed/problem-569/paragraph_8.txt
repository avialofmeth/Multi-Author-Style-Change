Are you trying to count interest from the fund? You canâ€™t balance the budget with that if the fund is being depleted because the interest goes away. Even if you did balance the budget with that, COLA is the highest it has been in decades, inflation fast outpacing the meager interest. We need a self-sustaining SSA and the only way to do that is to take in as much money as it disburses.
