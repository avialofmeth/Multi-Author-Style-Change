EDIT: Let me be perfectly clear; this "political intrigue" stuff is just clickbait. When McCarthy gets all but two or three GOP protest votes for Speaker, the media narrative will be how the Dems "failed" to take advantage of Republican disarray. The outcome is certain. The media just needs this horserace to get your clicks.
