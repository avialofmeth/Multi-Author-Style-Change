I came here to say this. If they make a new law enforcement agency, who is vetting the people being hired into it? Or are they just moving in LEO's from other agencies? If all you do is move, or hire in more far-right lunatics, they'll just step aside and let insurrectionists in the capitol just like most of the capitol police did last time.
