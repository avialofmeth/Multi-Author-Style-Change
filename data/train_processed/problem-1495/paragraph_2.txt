People I know from the field (academics in environmental science) are already admitting it behind closed doors. Unless there are major technological breakthroughs in a lot of different fields, we are boned. That or we all universally agree that businesses and politicians aren't really doing and aren't going to do anything serious about it and somehow over turn them, and also accept that we are all going to have to lower our standards of living by a significant amount (baring those technological breakthroughs).
