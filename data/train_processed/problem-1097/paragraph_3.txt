I heard Andrew Weissman say something about looking out for an announcement about charges on or just after the 24th of January. I'm not sure why he said that specific date, but I'm primed for that time since for some reason, it seems to line up to me like a reasonable time period following the special grand jury being wrapped up. Everything takes "two weeks", and it may be in a grand jury's hands already (to indict - the special grand jury was not for that, only for investigative purposes), so the end of the month should be fun, hopefully Superbowl season will be wild.
