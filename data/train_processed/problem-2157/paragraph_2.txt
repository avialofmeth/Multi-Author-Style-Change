That is a rather peculiar phenomenon. After the war nazism was widespread in these countries. People were indoctrinated by the millions, it was impossible to change that in a short time. You can not imprison half of the population and you can not reverse decades of forced propaganda. So they simply banned being a nazi. You could not say specific things. So yes, it was a special case of reducing free speech.
