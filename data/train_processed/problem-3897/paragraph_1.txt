More of an army green, really. With a camo pattern made out of â‚¬ symbols. Party leader and current German foreign minister is a product of the Young Global Leaders program of the World Economic Forum. That party has been overtaken and transformed from somewhat hippie and pacifist roots into thinly veiled capitalism apologists with plenty of ties to the military-industrial complex. Their unique selling point is making people feel better by symbolic policies, while preventing any substantial change. Demographically, their voters have the highest average earnings amongst the entire political spectrum in Germany, so about as establishment as it gets.
