I mean, we’ll wait for OP to clarify, but I don’t think very many people are feeling bad for McConnell or McCarthy. They just got a small taste of how many, many people feel about their betrayal of America. Personally, it might be the first real “fuck you” that may have registered for them. (better make sure thry get it, just in case).
