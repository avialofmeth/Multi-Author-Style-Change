After the Bruen decision it's basically going to take a constitutional amendment or grossly stacking the courts to overturn Bruen to have any concept of modern "gun control" be considered constitutional. The whole "history and tradition" thing fucked gun control good and hard. I mean realistically there were SCOTUS precedent before Bruen that should have done that but Bruen was basically a giant SCOTUS middle finger to gun control.
