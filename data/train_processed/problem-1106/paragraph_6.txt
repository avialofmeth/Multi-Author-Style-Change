In the early Clinton days I always felt the jealousy (and the lust) incle-boys Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich had for the Clintons. Lust for them and extreme jealousy of Bill's charisma. Once I realized that, listening to the RUsh Limbaugh show was a daily rant on that subject. They always tried to nail the Clintons, and of course, they never had anything on them.
