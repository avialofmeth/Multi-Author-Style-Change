I'm glad you were introspective and self-aware enough to admit a lack of knowledge. I share your concern for increasing conservatism and regressivism in America and in Indonesia. Indonesia has a lot of problems - more than America I'd wager. And I'm not a fan of religion, period. I just don't think it's fair when the largest Muslim country, and the third largest democracy in the world, gets lumped in with more extremist and regressive countries like Iran.
