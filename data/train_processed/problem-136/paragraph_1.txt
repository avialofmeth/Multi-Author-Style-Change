Bitching about it in a monetary sense and wanting Russia to win are two very different things. The stance they seem to be taking is “other countries aren’t pouring this much money into this conflict, and we’re damn near the furthest away from it all, so why are we giving so much money to them when it could stay here?”. Now I don’t agree with that and I’m actually glad we’re helping Ukraine. But don’t twist that shit, the vast majority of people in the US want Ukraine to win or just want us to stop sending money bc it isn’t our fight. Both are reasonable and should be debated.
