As I said: According to international maritime law both the flag state and the coastal states have a responsibility to work together to find a solution in case the ship cannot find a port that is willing to allow the people they rescued disembark. Them being stuck on the vessel that rescued them is not a solution. It's also just not going to work. At some point supplies will run out.
