This bill may go a bit far. Better plan. Remove sales from convenience and grocery stores. Leave it open for dedicated tobacco shops like marijuana dispensaries. Maybe even let dispensaries sell. This pushes out the massive mass market cigarettes and chew but still allows for cigars and the like. Dedicates shops are better at keeping the underage out and removes the product from being near schools.
