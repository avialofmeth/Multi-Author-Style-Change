I’m a dog lover and have no hate for any breeds, but I’m always super curious as to why people seem to defend pitbulls so much. The only thing that comes to mind is people that might have grown up with them and have that kind of connection? Otherwise it’s odd to defend a breed that stands out when it comes to incidents with humans. Especially very tragic ones. I know there are far better behaved and safer dog breeds to have around for home protection, if that’s what people are looking for.
