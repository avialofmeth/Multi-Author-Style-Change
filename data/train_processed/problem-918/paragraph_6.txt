The point here is that the US is nothing like Russia when it comes to access to information. The Russian gov't has blocked virtually everything that isn't Russian media. It might work on the older folks who don't fucking know how to use the internet but they're not the ones who fight wars. Not to mention, because of all the bullshit the US gov't started before people had access to this information, younger Americans are so anti-war at this point that virtually nothing aside from nukes dropping would get a majority of them on board with going to war with China. We've been in pointless, bullshit wars their entire lives; I sincerely doubt they'll be rushing to pick up rifles over some shady shit that they'll certainly see the opposite side of on the internet.
