Because wildfires are a yearly thing and 90% of the time, its just smoke in the valleys that looks like fog, smells like a camp fire and its not that big of a big deal. LOL You just get used to wildfires in the summers. Unless you are in the evac zones for a fire, they are just a minor inconvenience.
