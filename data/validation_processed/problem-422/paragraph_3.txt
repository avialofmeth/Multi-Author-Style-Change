With private assets, it's slightly easier to do, but here another problem arises. The moment USA/EU state out loud they can seize anything belonging to a citizen of nation they don't like, no sane person from South America, Asia and Africa (from anywhere, really) will ever store all of their fortune in a NATO country again, and over time, neither will their countries. Simply because a precedent has been set.
