While I agree with your comment in general, I think your representation of Taiwan's political situation is wrong. In particular, it's not that "they never established sovereignty on a global-scale", it's that they lost such recognition. Taiwan (or rather, Republic of China) was the only China there was for decades, and even after the civil war and establishment of the PRC on the mainland, ROC was a permanent member of the UN SC until 1971. Your post seems to suggest that Taiwan is a separatist state trying to break away from "their former imperialist regime". No. Taiwan is the former imperialist regime.
