Yea I completely understand your point and your level of frustration, which I share to a degree. I do respectfully disagree with your time assessment, particularly for the Mar-a-lago case. Reason being is its just not a complicated case. If it were literally anyone else they'd have been arraigned and probably in trial by now. The only thing complicating matters is who the "defendant " is. I truly believe we'll see an indictment on that by February latest.
