It does, but it also shows how our country is almost evenly split, creating the most possible “losers”. It’s not good because it breeds more anger, outrage and division. I hope one day it’s more like 80% to 20%. Also I hope we can get rid of the electoral college and gerrymandering. But I don’t really understand why we have those things in the first place so maybe I’m wrong.
