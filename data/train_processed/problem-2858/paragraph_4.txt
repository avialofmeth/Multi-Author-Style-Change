Yeah just wait until the SCOTUS decides that state legislatures can override the will of the people in presidential elections and choose the candidate they want to win instead. Let's say, for example, in 2024 Wisconsin votes for Biden(as they did last time) the Republican legislature would be able to say, "No, we get to choose the president" and they send in a slate of Republican electors instead.
