I'm liberal for 2008 standards, probably considered left leaning in 2023. I reside in Oregon. I own guns. I don't like the 3 day loop hole. But they passed 114 with nothing in place. Youre required to get a permit.... I'm fine with that, but there's no permit in place or process. Ending every single gun purchase in the state for the foreseeable future. "Including to law enforcement agencies" but I doubt that...
