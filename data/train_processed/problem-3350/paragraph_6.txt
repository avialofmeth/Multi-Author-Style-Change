Sure, over sea they can be a problem. But think about the ones that go down over land - that could make a cozy nest for a squirrel. Imagine a little nook in a broken tree, where for a few hours a day, the nest gets sunlight, and the shiny material gets all hot so by the time the squirrel gets home from a long day of nut hunting, the nest is all cozy and warm, and the squirrel can snuggle up like a cat in the dryer - maybe with a sexy 2nd squirrel. Or it could land on the back of a bear and get tangled in its matted fur, so now you have a bear with a cape who dominates the ecosystem as the new reigning monarch. And when that bear dies, its resourceful cubs will fight to the death over who gets to inherit their beloved father's cape, but in the end, one blood spattered and heartbroken bear cub will realize it does not know how to don a cape. Because it's just a dumb bear.
