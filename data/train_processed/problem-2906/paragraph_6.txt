Honestly, any red state. If you can stomach the terrible politics and have decent skills that can get you either a WFH/remote job or a job in an industry in that particular state, you can have your pick. Just learn to block out the people who are more obnoxious and adjust accordingly. I'm not taking any chances and got sterilized last year, so no need to worry about access to abortion. I also vote every single year in every single election, I wouldn't consider skipping voting.
