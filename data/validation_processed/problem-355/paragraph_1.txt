It does make a mad kind of sense, he his running through devolvement at a rapid pace, clearly he has gotten help from Russia and China but that is only half the game, he needs to bring his missiles and his people up to a modern competitive standard, and there is zero way to avoid getting the experience by drilling. He is also doing it in a very provocative way but the people on all sides can see real advancement and a structured program. I will add to that Kim will be testing nuke warheads again soon, this may or may not be in conjunction with China or Russia, but let's say your Russia and you really need to test your nuke stockpile or new designs but how are you going to do that with the world watching?
