You don't need term limits if you get rid of voter suppression and gerrymander districts and make voting accessible by having a national mail-in voting law. Then when elected officials don't represent the people the people can just vote them out. Term limits are just a Band-Aid that do not address the actual issues of why people like Mitch McConnell keep getting elected.
