Scientists have also been pointing at the fault line under Istanbul for decades now and keep saying that when (not if) a quake finally happens in that fault line it will cause one of the worst catastrophes the world will ever see. Istanbul still has around 90,000 risky buildings today. I can't even imagine a scenario where half of them go down.
