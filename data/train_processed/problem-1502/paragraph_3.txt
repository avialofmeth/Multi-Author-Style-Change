To make up for it. Pretty wise since gepard has been useful at shooting down the 20k suicide bomb drones, a Ukrainian gepard operator said just 3 short bursts and the drone is down. Less expensive than using anti air missiles (s300 - 140k, modern defense systems 400-500k )and easier to operate 24/7 compared to manpads.
