In principle you're not wrong, except one massive issue with the LastPass breach is the passwords weren't guaranteed to be hashed with a sufficient number of iterations. The standard minimum these days is 100,000 iterations but if you had an old account (merely more than a couple years) then your master password might only have 5000 hashes which is readily attackable especially if it wasn't super complex (but even somewhat attack even if it was complex). The fact that they didn't update the iterations automatically over time but just left it at the "factory' setting in your profile was an absolute miscarriage of security.
