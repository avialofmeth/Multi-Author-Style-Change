Seems like the EU is ahead of us in attitudes toward security. I personally have had my information lost in too many data breaches to keep track in my mind, healthcare and other businesses’ insufficient security has been the root cause of all. Each offers standard 2 years of credit monitoring or Norton or similar. I’ve been given this enough times that it is almost a moot point now They overlap I’d like to see more serious consequences than 2 year’s worth of Norton per person. They probably get a discount from Norton anyway for the size of the breaches and therefore the number of “new” customers.
