This guy participated in the coup-at-large, attempting to disenfranchise voters to swing the election to Trump. He took steps to dismantle and remove custom postal sorting machines and throw them out. How he is still in power is baffling. I think Biden needs to take stronger steps to remove him and people that did similar things in furtherance of the big lie and the criminal conspiracy to steal the election and end democracy.
