I mean, what is he going to do besides confess to another crime and beg grandmas for money? We have had six years of that. He is going to have up the stakes a bit if he wants the clicks. Nothing we have seen before like proclaiming his lust for his daughter or easily disproven lies about how big his crowds are or how strong and healthy he is. I would say go to space, but that has been played out. Maybe he could dig up Ivana like Geraldo with the vault, though that really didn’t play well. He could jump a jet ski over a penned in shark, though. That would be cool. Maybe wear a boss leather jacket while doing it.
