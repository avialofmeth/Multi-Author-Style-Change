The right lives in an obnoxious upside down reality. Reading r/conservative is always a wild trip where they’re always going on about how privileged everyone else is, how persecuted they are, etc while they continuously win all the participation trophies. Theres no reasoning with people who are always screeching that up is down. It’s exhausting.
