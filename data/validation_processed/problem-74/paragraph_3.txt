Yeah, that was quite irresponsible from Israeli authorities. I understand why they wanted it to be perceived as them having more clout with the Swedish government than Erdogan and also they wanted to get all the praise for preventing that event from taking place, but those statements from Israeli Foreign Ministry and ambassador painted a completely wrong picture of how it went down.
