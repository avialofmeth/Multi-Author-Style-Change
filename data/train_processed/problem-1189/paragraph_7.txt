Look at the Georgia senate race. Warnock is a pretty solid candidate. He’s got a good background before entering politics and seems to be pretty smart on the issues. Walker has fucker up everything, even going to so far as to tell voters he’s “not very smart” and flashed a fake police badge on a debate stage (amongst a million other things. Yet the polling comes in and he’s still within the margin of error. Wtf? I honestly don’t know how you reach these people when they are so blind to realoty.
