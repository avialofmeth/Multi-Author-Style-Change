A lot of faculty are edge-lords. I went to Yale and the majority of the professors I knew there had serious personality flaws. You don’t get hired at a place like that because you’re a well rounded person, you get there because you’ve poured your entire life into a single academic area and the politics that come with it. The result is that most of these people are adult children with massively underdeveloped social skills and empathy.
