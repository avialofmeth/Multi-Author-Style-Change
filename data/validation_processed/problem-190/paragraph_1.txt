In this election season, John Gibbs and Ann Coulter are both doing speeches saying that women shouldn't have the right to vote. Abortion and using birth control are being taken away from women. Who's to say what's next. Banning women from working, from driving? From dressing in a way that might cause a man to rape them? (Shifting the blame to the woman). All are real possibilities now in the wonderful toxic USA that desperately wants the 1950s back.
