I would argue that a belief in life after death carries implications that could possibly corrupt a person. I would argue that a belief that "I'm too smart to fall for something like that, unlike the rest of these rubes" could be similarly corrupting. The fact of the matter is, all humans wake up in the morning, and immediately assemble a self-serving fiction that gives purpose and meaning to their lives. If it just so happens to be religion, that in itself isn't a disqualifier. The point isn't whether or not politicians can or can't be religious, or can or can't be religiously motivated, the point is that "faith" is not a sufficient justification when it comes to policy. "God says so" DO NOT make the words coming out of somebody's mouth more powerful or meaningful.
