This is our plan, too. Thankfully made it through a healthy but higher risk pregnancy and delivery this year before the “heartbeat bill” took place. But we will not continue to grow or raise our family in the state Texas has become - and will become if the GOP wins this one again. I refuse to be in a situation where my or anyone else’s pregnancy is anyone else’s decision but my or their own.
