Everywhere in the world there is one species on the brink of extinction which is vital to supporting the ecosystem of it's respective region. Once that species goes extinct a vital crop which humans rely on will be also go extinct and then once it's too late people will start caring. In 10 to 15 years once we've allowed the people facilitating the raping of planet earth to have brought our very delicate balance with nature crashing into a brick wall, it will have been too late and we'll all go crashing down as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg among others vye for the right to fly away into space far from this shit storm they helped create.
