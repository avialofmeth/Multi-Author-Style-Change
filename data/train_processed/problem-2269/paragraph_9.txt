Agree to disagree I guess. When a bunch of guys surrender and one of them pulls a gun, no one surrendered and all of them are enemy combatants. Every single one of the guys on the floor could, and should, be assumed armed with ill intent at that point. It's not a war crime to save your own freaking life.
