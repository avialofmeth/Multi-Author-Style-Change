Sorry that I'm not celebrating our government bankrolling a completely unnecessary extension of the bloodshed and loss of life. War is an abject evil, and any action that extends it or that stands in the way of immediate peace discussions to any without any preconditions from either party to any degree is equally evil and morally abhorrent.
