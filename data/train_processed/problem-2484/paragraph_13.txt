I read that they are saying “WTF he’s the President and we all said it was on the record.” Common sense would make me think that in this case there shouldn’t have been any expectation of privacy with the tapes and I assume there was no contract. But laws around writing a book and recording of audio is different. For example the whole music recording industry throughout history. I’m of the thought the tapes were Woodward’s property to do with what he wanted. If Fuckface Von Clownstick wanted to make money off them then he should have… made a deal. This just goes back to him having no idea who Woodward is.
