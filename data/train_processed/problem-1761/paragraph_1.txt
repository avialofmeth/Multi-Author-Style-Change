I mean the Pope does this often enough. There is an entire portion of the history of the Papacy called "the Pornocracy" because they were so far off. (The Papacy had fallen under the control of a pair of Roman aristocratic families and was basically being transferred between the two in a feud with lots of bribery, stabbing, etc.) The Pope has also apologized for the Doctrine of Discovery and other historical errors. Most American Christians are Protestants of a peculiar type and I think lots of Catholics in the US are far too into the culture war thing and do and say very unchristian things.
