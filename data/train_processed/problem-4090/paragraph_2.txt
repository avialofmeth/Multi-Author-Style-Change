Iâ€™m curious, and maybe not informed enough. I figured in these scenarios in a currently theocratic country like Iran that simply another religious leader would likely fill the void and try to at least go through the motions of holding actual democratic elections with whoever wants to run on the ballot (ideally), and tell people what they want to hear otherwise.
