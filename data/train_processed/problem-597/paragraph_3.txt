In practical terms I am not sure how much use it will be, as I strongly suspect that the source of "tolerance misinformation" has never been from advocates and allies, but rather from those with nefarious or dishonest aims. Those types love to use faulty rhetorical arguments to try and redefine positive things as self defeating concepts, but the premises they use are absurd on their face.
