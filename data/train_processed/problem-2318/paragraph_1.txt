Kurzgesa have a video called optimistic nihilism, which explains a bit about their standpoints, even if they mainly try to keep a scientific and objective stance, it’s difficult to not put any value into it, and I think it makes sense the way they do it. If there is any blatant scientific misinformation that’s one thing, and if you have examples of that I would love to know.
