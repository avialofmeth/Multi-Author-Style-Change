Israel helped Ukraine more than Ukraine has helped itself? Nonsense. We're at 140,000 Ukranians dead and they're fighting all by themselves. How many Israelis have died in all the wars they've ever fought? 8,000? 9,000? There's absolutely no comparison. What Ukraine is suffering is far worse than anything Israel has endured both in terms of lives and infrastructure destroyed.
