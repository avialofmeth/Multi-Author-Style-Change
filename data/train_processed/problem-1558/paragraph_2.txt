Personally, I think he has the type of personality and influence that could have actually achieved things on a global stage but he chose not to take hard lines on things and as a result I'm incredibly annoyed at his disappointing leadership. (Although a minority government makes it hard to get anything done, if he had a spine and teamed up with the ndp more then he could have gotten a lot more done).
