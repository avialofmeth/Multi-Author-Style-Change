Also, bear in mind that the Dems lost the house popular vote by like 3% and if we take uncontested races into account, iirc they'd have still likely lost by an estimated 1 or 2%, so if the maps across the nation were fair, the Dems still would have lost the house. Ultimately there's a big failure by the voters there.
