There are a few who put Ukrainian flags on their profile and support Ukraine - but others who either put blithering statements saying Ukraine should seek a 'Russian peace' or just support Putin. I'm still friends with any that support Ukraine, but the others can go get fucked. The worst offenders (that I know are still on Visas) I have reported to the government with screenshots of the hate speech. They are too stupid and just think they can post hate speech and call Ukrainians denigrating names on Facebook/Twitter/Telegram etc. without consequence. Hopefully the relevant Irish/British authorities will kick them out when their visas are up for renewal.
