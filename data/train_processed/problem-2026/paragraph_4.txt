I live in Finland so I am very aware of Russian influence. However script kiddies DDOS attacks are really not a threat in scale of things, invasion is. Finland has been preparing for attack for 80+ years and given that Russia is losing in Ukraine they are in no position to pose real threat to Finland. And Sweden is buffered by Finland.
