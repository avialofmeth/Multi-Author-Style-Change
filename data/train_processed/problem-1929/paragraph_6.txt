The same Libertarians that virtue signal about Twitter finally being their safe space, somehow unironically? Or who celebrate Kanye and (used to) Reagan, but who chastise Kathy Griffin and other “celebs” for not sticking to acting? Also the free market can ask for more pay, like right now, and they lose their shit over the WoRkFoRcE.
