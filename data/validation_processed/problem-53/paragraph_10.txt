So… dreadful person basically describes any GOP presidential nominee, and he is one of the front runners for that. So yes, if he wins that primary, he absolutely has a shot. I’m not saying he’d definitely win, but in a 2 party system as polarized as it is today, should he be the nominee his chances would be 20% at absolute worst, and those are real, terrifying odds.
