Yes, the militias are extremely exhausted (especially the LPR one) and are mostly used for garrisoning now. They are usually easily recognized by their haphazard collection of old Soviet gear (and I mean old, bolt action rifles and 1950’s helmets old), looted Ukrainian stuff and whatever modern kit the Russian Army is giving them when filming a propaganda piece. I think the last significant operation they took part in was carrying out the sham referendum in the occupied territories. Still, there should still be a few thousand running around of each, so I felt I had to mention them if I’m also mentioning the other small volunteer and mercenary units.
