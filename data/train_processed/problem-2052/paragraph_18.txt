That leaves only ONE NEW GROUP that can be tapped into to get an edge over Republicans: The Youth. And again, I'll repeat this: The Youth Group built off a grassroots campaign is what propelled Obama twice to Presidency. Again: Only Warren as VP can tap that group. Even if they don't turn out in large numbers themselves: the youth is who does the canvassing, the groundwork, the phone-banking, and pushing back against trolls on social media. Without them, turnout across all demographics drops while right-wing online trolls amplify because there's no technologically-savvy group to counter the rhetoric from the other side.
