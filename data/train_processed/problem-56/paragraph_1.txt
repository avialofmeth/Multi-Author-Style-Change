What’s up with that? I’ve even seen Russians in Russia say they have more freedom and opportunities than anywhere else, which is obviously incorrect. I assume they think this way because they watch their Fox News equivalent constantly, RT, is it? They seem to really love watching state TV over there. And who could blame them, sounds like a blast, watching Steven Seagal say how strong Russia is. That guy is so compromised it’s actually sad.
