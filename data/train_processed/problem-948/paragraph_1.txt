The emphasis on Europeans hating Americans is utterly wrong for major parts of Europe. Sure we do believe the stereotypes about “stupid Americans” but you’re loved as a nation in certain parts. Poland for example is not only so happy to have US military presence but also glorifies America to a major extent. Hell our government will probably bend over backwards to your will. Not to mention we were one of few nations who was spending the established 2% of GDP on military.
