I have yet to find locate suitable work in rural Ohio (since moving just prior to covid). My wife took a job that advanced her career so we moved. However, many of the people she works with have frozen mindsets and cultural habits from out of the 1950s, quite to the detriment of the clients and future of the org (but of course they don't think that).
