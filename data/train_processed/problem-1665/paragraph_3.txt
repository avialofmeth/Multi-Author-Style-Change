things related to north korea are beyond right vs left. you don't know the relationship between the minjoo party and Kim's regime, so get your ignorant ass out of SK politics. NK spies have had free reign over the past 5 years because of a leftie president, NK defectors were forcefully deported back, and the left wing gave hundreds of millions to NK over the past 30 years under the "sunshine policy".
