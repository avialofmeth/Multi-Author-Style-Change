Panspermia is a bad theory because it's just moves the question from how on earth to how somewhere else. Also the fact that you can find all five bases (4 for DNA and uracil for RNA) doesn't prove that DNA or RNA came to earth from space. After all it is just 5 simple chemicals which could form spuriously in many places. I would read this in different way. If those chemicals could form in quite cold and inert environment of space (in case this meteorites never've been a part of another planet) then chances for them to form in warm chemicaly active invironment of other planets quite high. And our carbon based life may be way more common then we thought.
