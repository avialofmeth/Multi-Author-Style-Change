The way I see it, is that it obviously has to do with her race and her party. How are Republicans going to punish a single person in Congress before they punish Santos? It comes off as if they think that other members of Congress deserve to be punished but the worst one of all of them who continues to break the law and lie at every turn not only doesn't deserve to be punished but deserves to be rewarded by being placed on committees. Until Republicans remove Santos they have absolutely no excuse to punish anyone else.
