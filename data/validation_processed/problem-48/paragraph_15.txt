Which was done intentionally which allows the Senate to ignore it completely and/or vote it down. An insulting, token measure. If they were serious about it, those 7 days would be included in the main (and only) bill passed to the Senate, forcing them to pass it if a strike was that dire. Give these workers PTO. A single day is insulting.
