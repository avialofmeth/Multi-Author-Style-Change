People are allies and that isn't how it is done. What you see now is the pressure of diplomacy. It is very clear that Finland and Poland at least and other sources say 15 countries want to donate tanks and that Germany feels the move is too much of an escalation. Switzerland has also blocked re-export of things. Germany had a policy of no sending arms into conflict zones and offered helmets for which they were much mocked. Under the CDU they let the military rot to nothing. The country is very not aggressive and has clung to that out of their historical mistakes. Makes sense and the amount they have changed in less than a year is a lot. So it just makes sense they aren't there yet. Change is hard. While there is some bad blood between Germany and Poland you might point at, Finland is hardly an arch enemy. My read it as I said, Germany is having a hard time going farther than they have, the fear of OMG Russia is going to attack us is fading and they are returning to more timid policy.
