Who are you comparing it to? Countries in Central/South America? Sub-Saharan Africa? South and South-East Asia? Probably not too bad. The citizens of the home nations of the Great Empires? Probably not too good. The middle class is a fairly recent thing, and life has never been good for the serfs, peasants, or near-slaves owned by the local nobility.
