I love my state of Iowa, we will produce likely over 60% of our electric energy from wind alone this year, last year was 57%. People complain it's not reliable like down in texas when they had blackouts. I've lost power three times in the last 20 years, the first it was when a tornado came through and was at work we still ran off backup power working from the basement till main power came back after an hour, the second time it was out for 5 minutes during a blizzard, the third it was out for 20 minutes also during a blizzard. Reliability comes down to maintenance, upgrading and redundancy all of which texas lacks. My utility company does an amazing job and personally think costs are very reasonable with the service they provide.
