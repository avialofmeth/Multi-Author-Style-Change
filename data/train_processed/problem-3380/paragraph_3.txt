A 9 seat majority for Republicans means that only 5 need to defect (2% of Republicans), to get Dem bills passed. If you think about it, the filibuster in the Senate is a substantially higher burden to overcome. If a bill starts in the Senate, and gets passed, then that means it got 9 Republican senators (about 20% of the Republican delegation), so it doesn't seem too unlikely that it'd pass in the House.
