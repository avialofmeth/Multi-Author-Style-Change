They don't give a fuck about the impact of their agenda. The only thing they care about it pulling the wool over Republican voters' eyes to prevent them from seeing the pick-pocketing thieves we call "donors". Same thing with abortion and guns. Anyone who thinks stopping abortion, opposing gun control, or fighting LGBT communities are worthy causes is a massive fucking rube. Let our country deteriorate while you clutch your tacticool gun, happy you no longer have to use the proper pronoun or see guys kissing on TV. That's about the extent of eudaimonia you're going to get with conservative ideology.
