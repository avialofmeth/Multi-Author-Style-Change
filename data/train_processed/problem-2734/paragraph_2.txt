What a terrible shame it would be if US businesses were forced to manufacture their products in America, Mexico and Canada. We need a green new deal? We talk about forcing consumers in the future to use electric cars.. look at how much fuel it takes for a single container ship to take its cheaply made bullshit from China to the USA, then truck all that crap from the port to the warehouses, stores and finally the consumer.
