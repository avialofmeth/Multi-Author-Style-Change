Thank you The TV really looks at you in Russia – in the store, in the cafe, and so on. You can’t get away from it, it will get you everywhere. Corruption is what has degraded Putin and his entourage, which is why they started the war, thinking that Europe and the U.S. would not benefit from stopping them. One small consolation: corruption has led to the deplorable state of the Russian army. Isn’t that useful.
