honestly as an american who just barely skims UK politics as to not be completely unaware of whats going on. Rishi Sunak just looks "under cooked" for the job when i see him in pictures. he's good looking in a way id usually call charismatic. almost as much as Trudeau in canada. but unlike trudeau theres just something underneath the surface that screams DISCOMFORT that i cant quite place my finger on.
