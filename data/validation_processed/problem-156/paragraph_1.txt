I lived in Vietnam for 6 years and was pretty good at only drinking in places that served real booze (avoid the tourist bars that offer insanely cheap drinks, basically), but I got unlucky one time at a foreigner-owned bar that had been sold some counterfeit liquor. My friend and I had four cocktails and were so drunk that neither of us could walk. Our wives were so fucking mad at us for getting as shitfaced as we had at 9:00 p.m. before we got in touch and realized what had happened. Scary shit because I think if we had stayed any longer we might have been in for a trip to the hospital. Right when I arrived in Vietnam there were three separate instances of foreigners dying from drinking counterfeit booze.
