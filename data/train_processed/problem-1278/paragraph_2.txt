Yea… when Russia desperately needs weapons to arm his new soldiers for the mass murder they are committing in Ukraine they start a joint venture to manufacture millions of Russian Assault Rifles just for India…come on. Don’t be naive. Some of those weapons are going straight into the hands of Russian Soldiers. This is just a convenient way for India to get the guns to arm their soldiers while also supporting Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
