Oh I know. I spent the first part of my career in environmental regulatory compliance. The shift away from preserving the environment has been a massive propaganda campaign. As much as I loathe "both sides" arguments, I have experienced the adverse affects of greenwashing or hard-line not-necessarily-science backed campaigns. The end result has a similar effect as pro-capitalist efforts - no one passes workable legislation and the public turns against supporting environmental causes on a broad scale.
