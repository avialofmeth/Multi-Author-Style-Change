It’s absolutely is not. I say this as someone who at a time had to choose between food to eat and gas in my car. It’s hard to understand or fathom when you’re at such a low income what having a salary like that actually means. My household income is north of $200k and people think I have a truckload of money. It is nowhere close to that. But when you’re making under $50k, $200k+ seems like a pipe dream and you think someone making that is akin to winning the lottery. All of my friends have household incomes above $200k. Not a single one drives a luxury car, has a boat, or lives in a multimillion dollar house. It’s a fallacy to think we have truckloads of money just sitting around waiting for us to do whatever we want.
