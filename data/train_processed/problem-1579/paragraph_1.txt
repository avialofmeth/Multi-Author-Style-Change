DeSantis might run, he might win and that would be fucking awful, but I just can’t see him holding his own on a debate stage. He’s younger sure, but he’s super fucking awkward and can’t think on his feet. There are a lot of videos of him getting snippy at reporters for asking simple questions. That might work in fascist Florida, but I don’t think it’ll fly well for independents on a national level.
