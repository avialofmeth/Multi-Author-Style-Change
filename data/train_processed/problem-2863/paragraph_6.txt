All that said, it's still a wildly stupid bill. It was done to purely give the illusion that DeSantis "beat" Disney in a culture war. I've already seen Republicans celebrating that Disney is now going to "pay their fair share" without realize that Disney, through the RCID, has always been paying more than their fair share and that this bill will not impact their tax burden in either direction.
