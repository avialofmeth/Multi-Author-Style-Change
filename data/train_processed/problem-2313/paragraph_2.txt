Also, if I recall, the RAF as it stands lacks actual dedicated long range bombers. Whether that's a pressing problem for British military doctrine I don't know but I'm pretty sure the last of the Avro Vulcans have been pulled out of service decades ago. Most air forces have moved towards using multi-role fighters.
