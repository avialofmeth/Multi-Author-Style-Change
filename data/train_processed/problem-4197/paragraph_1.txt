I’m all for Trump getting sued to shit, but I don’t think the Capitol Police has any moral right to sue whatsoever. They chose not to do their job (surprising for cops, right?), move barricades and willingly allowed insurrectionists into the Capitol itself. They showed how racist they really are by not even using kiddie gloves to handle the situation, while brutally taking a “law and order” stance to peaceful BLM assemblies the summer before. And then they cried and complained about how rough that day was for months, as if they didn’t realize it was THEIR job to begin with to protect and serve the Capitol.
