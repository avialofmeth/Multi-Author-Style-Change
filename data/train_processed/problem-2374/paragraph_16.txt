But yeah you can't expect more foresight than to the end of the next business quarter because if companies wouldn't focus 100% on the short term and instead think about what a smart move for more than the next few months would be how could shareholders live with making 5% less this business year. Wait until that pays off next year? Preposterous! /s.
