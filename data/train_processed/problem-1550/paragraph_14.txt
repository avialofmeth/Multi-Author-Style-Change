If countries want to deliver Leopards, they're free to do so. This has been clearly stated by our vice-chancellor. Any "blockade" by germany could be easy exposed by just handing in an export request, uploading a picture of it on twitter and tagging the german gov. With the amounts of aid we've sent, the amounts of refugees we've taken in and the speed we'd ended any dependence on russia, I think a large part of those EU countries constantly pointing fingers should maybe point them at themselves, for once.
