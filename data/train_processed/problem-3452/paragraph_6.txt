The coalition Netanyahu is building is not a monolith. Ben-Gvir is looking to be treading the same steps as Lieberman and Bennett; if he continues on the path of radicalization, which is not in line with Likud's beliefs, it is a matter of time before the right wing will fracture as Likud is heavily composed of centrists who bought into the delusion marketed by Bibi that the center-left (Lapid; Likud being center-right) is in any way different from the Likud besides not being led by him.
