From a medical perspective, China cannot afford to have a full COVID wave even today. They have refused western vaccines and their homemade ones are lacklustre at best. If China will reopen like the rest of the world has done today, their hospitals will buckle like most other nations did in early 2020. Everyone will know someone who fell very sick or died to COVID. In the US, it cost the president his re-election. In China, it could cost Xi his career, legacy, and perhaps even more.
