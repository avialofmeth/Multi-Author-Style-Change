I don't mind that I'm being downvoted, that's kinda why I posted it, just to say "we all can get greedy". But you are completely right, it's a duality of people like me, which, is a lot of people, basically anyone who makes it to the point where they can afford to buy in a super hot market doesn't want to lose ground on that investment if they can help it, it's self preservation. And, it extends beyond just the financial aspect of it to be honest, some of these proposed projects would really fuck with people's ability to get around, commute, etc, which is HUGE in some areas, you buy a house for it's location and commute to wherever you work a lot of the time. If suddenly you have to add an hour each day because of construction and whatever that's going to be enough for a lot of people to just say "no".
