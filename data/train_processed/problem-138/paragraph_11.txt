But what is there to save, and how? If he could realistically keep some parts of ukraine, it would make sence, but as far as i understand it, time ticks against russia, they are losing soldiers and equipment that they cant replace, whereas ukraine is getting more and more modern weapons and support and their resources seem limitless. I really thought that if Putin left ukraine before the counter-offensive started and said that he destroyed ukraine, russian citizens would buy that. There is zero chance he can keep anything, ukraine would rebel even on its own again and again until they were free.
