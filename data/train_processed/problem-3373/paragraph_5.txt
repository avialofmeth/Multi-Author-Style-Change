In practical terms, Ojibwe is to be widely taught as a single language across the entire Great Lakes. It would need to be universalized more in terms of pronunciation, spelling, and grammar to ever be recognized for things like widespread textbooks, AP exams or certification tests. There are already conferences for experts in the language, but some governing body would need to choose either a dominant accent or pick and choose from all the tribal dialects. It's closer to a French and Spanish situation than a british vs american accent thing if you compare all of them.
