This doesnt make sense to me. The GOP has since Roe v Wade was handed down, targeted that decision. Tons and tons of money and manpower was devoted for over a half-century into reversing that decision. It was no secret. They have plotted for decades to reverse it. If you are such a pro-choice supporter that it makes a difference in how you vote....how the hell were you voting for Republicans in the first place?
