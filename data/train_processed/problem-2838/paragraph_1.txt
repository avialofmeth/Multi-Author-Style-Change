Meat prices are definitely down recently. Some produce prices are way down, especially things like apples, oranges, green peppers etc. Center of the store items have not come down at all. Bread, eggs, some vegetables including Lettuce are not down at all. Jarred goods seem to be remaining very high while canned goods seem to have come down. It is definitely a very mixed bag.
