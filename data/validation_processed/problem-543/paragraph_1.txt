Also I love how anyone that is any type of conservative is automatically a racist or the like on here. Fiscal conservative is a thing. Do I want the government controlling everything hell no do I want them dolling out money to make people dependent and lazy god no. But that’s what people will vote for. Who will give me the most stuff. Welfare is the most racist thing out there. It was geared to make poor( at the time black) families dependent on the government to survive. Also the democrat party is finally being shown as it’s racists roots. Look at Biden super racist his whole life even says this and still people will blindly support him.
