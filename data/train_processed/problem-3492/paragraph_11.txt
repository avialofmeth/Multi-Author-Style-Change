You do understand the term white nationalist is not a bad thing. Nationalism is essentially the desire to put ones nation first before all others. White is just a term the media put in front of the world nationalist to make it seem racist or bigoted. I am very much a nationalist. I have pride in being a citizen of the United States, and I hope that people of all races in our nation felt the same. Conservative or Liberal I think we all need to take pride in the nation and come together to solve the problems both on a society level and in policy to make sure that "We The People" remains "We The People".
