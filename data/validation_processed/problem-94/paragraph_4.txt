do you know how long netanyahu has been in power and how corrupt he has been? does that seem like a functional democracy to you? the philippines are a "democracy" as well only in practice they function similarly to this, as an authoritarian dictatorship. hell, the US is barely a democracy, it's much closer to an oligarchy due to the influence of moneyed interests in politics.
