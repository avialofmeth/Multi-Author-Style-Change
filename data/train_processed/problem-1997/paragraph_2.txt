It’s sort of a natural consequence of how the UN operates in regards to Israel. They spend a lot of time and energy passing resolutions condemning Israel, far more than any other country, and for at least a few years now more than all other countries combined. You can criticize Israel and still think that’s nuts, and still understand why Israel would stop listening to the UN.
