What I hate about all of this is that Republicans are now throwing Trump under the bus because he is weak and are saying exactly what we have been saying about Trump the entire time. This demonstration is exactly what the party is all about Party Over Country. As long as you keep the party strong, you can do what you want, but if you make the party weak, we will tell the truth about you.
