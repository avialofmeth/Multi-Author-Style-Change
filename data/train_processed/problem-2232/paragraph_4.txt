It was my “small chance but not impossible” guess already back in April. That he would be hauled out in the square like Ghaddafi but I’m not sure Putin is as adamant to stay in the same position. I am also not sure to what degree that he is paranoid that his circle would turn on him either that he would flee and go into hiding prematurely.
