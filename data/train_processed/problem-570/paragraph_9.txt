Saw this recently:”Libertarians are like house cats, thinking they’re independent, but totally relying on a system they don’t understand”. We live in the United States, not separate little countries, although that is what the red states would have everyone believe, even though red states receive more from the fed than blue states, have higher crime rates, lower education results, higher mortality rates and on snd on.
