Any mention of his name from the officials means a lot for us. The islamic republic is a coward, meaning that if UN just like how they kicked them out of the women council, speak about the executions, they will be paralyzed and it would be a great chance for us to overthrow them. Yes, they would not be involved directly, but indirectly. Any truth spoken about this revolution and this executions will weaken the islamic republic.
