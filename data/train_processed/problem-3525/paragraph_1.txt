The focus should not be on that she stayed, but that what was done to her was horrible. To focus on one, and not the other makes it seem as if you only care about the one, and donâ€™t care about the other. Yes she could have avoided her fate had she left everything she cared about behind, but it would not have happened at all if the asshole in this situation had not been an asshole. Assholes are not intractable forces of nature, but humans who can - and ought to - be corrected, and so the argument is made that ire should be directed at assholes, and not their victims.
