The federal government made a deal with RWE: RWE is allowed to mine the coal sitting underneath the village, but instead of phasing out coal all together by 2038 they have to phase it out in 2030. Why are the protesters still pissed you ask? On the one hand Some studies suggest coal would have been unlucrative by 2030 anyway due to cost of the european CO2 emissions certificates trade, so RWE got the government fooled and is making quite some profit off of that. On the other hand some estimate the amount of coal around the village is almost as high as underneath it, so if RWE would mine that instead the village could be preserved.
