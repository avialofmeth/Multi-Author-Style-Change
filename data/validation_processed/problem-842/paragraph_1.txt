While I agree the world needs to rebalance after Covid, I have yet to see some hard and factual numbers that show we are either in a recession or headed there. But there is no guarantee. I just wish the media would shut up about the "talking heads" that have no economic backgrounds who keep yelling recession. If you say something enough, people will believe it and start acting that way. Just look at the Jam6 big lie to see how many Americans bought that rubbish and lies.
