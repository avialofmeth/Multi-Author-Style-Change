People who live in the city contribute to gas taxes if they own a vehicle that runs on gasoline or diesel, with higher adoption rates of EVs there is a higher loss of gas taxes going towards infrastructure. Evs do not pay enough in vehicle registrations fees to cover the loss in gas taxes. Again EVs need to have their vehicle registration fees increased significantly to cover the loss.
