Lukashenko is barely holding on to power and needed Russia to bail him out after the last election. The only thing keeping him in power is this army, and Russia's, which indirectly mean that he's beholden to them because there's nowhere else to turn to except for Russia. Compare that to Putin who has many PMC groups and militarized police forces that can be used to ensure that no one military faction can get strong enough to threaten him.
