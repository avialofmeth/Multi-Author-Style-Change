Also, Trump owns that party, they're all MAGA now. They may try to prop up DeSantis as an alternative, but that man is just the "We have Trump at home" version of Trump. Look at who they ran to when they couldn't get their shit together in the House. It wasn't McConnell or some other elder of the Republican, it wasn't former Speakers Ryan, Boehner, or Gingrich, and sure as shit wasn't anyone from the Bush or Cheney families. Nah, it was daddy himself, Trump. He's still the leader of the party and Republicans can't quit him, anyone that says otherwise is delusional.
