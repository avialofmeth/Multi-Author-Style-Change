Starting salary for teachers in Indiana is $38,000. Teachers can't even afford to live in housing and have to go out of pocket to buy supplies as schools have no money to buy it. Teachers make below poverty lines, and they have to teach using outdated textbooks too often. However, Republicans who slander teachers and constantly call on teachers to be fined if they teach things like evolution and gravitational theory are telling teachers to carry guns in school and put their lives on the line daily.
