As a canadian kid who attended several american schools I regularly dealt with coercive attempts to force me to pledge allegiance to a country I wasn’t a citizen of. Some high schools made everyone recite it daily and gave a lot of grief to anyone who didn’t participate. I was also expected to sing praises of the nation through their national anthem on a near constant basis.
