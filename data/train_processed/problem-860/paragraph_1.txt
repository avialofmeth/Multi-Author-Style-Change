Every program that has used means testing to determine eligibility is used to eventually eliminate the program. Those politicians opposed to it use the means as the precedent then constantly move those requirements/penalties until they get the desired outcome. It's really not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things and you did pay into it whether you're a billionaire or lower class. Just pay out that 12, 15 hundred a month to everyone qho paid in. If you're lower class it's spend boosting the economy. If you're upper class you do what you do anyway, invest it or pass it on to your grandkids. But means testing is a mistake imho.
