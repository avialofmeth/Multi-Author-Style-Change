I drive mostly full time for 5 different gig apps. I run my business pretty efficiently. My exact cost per mile has been 22 cents including all maintenance, depreciation and business use insurance. I drive a 2015 Honda fit with 106k miles. I'm also putting aside about 8 cents a mile for major repairs.
