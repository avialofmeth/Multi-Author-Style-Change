I’ve noticed that the degree to which conservatives hate an institution relates directly to how intensively that institution corrects error. Say what you will about the media, but most working stiffs at a newspaper would get in trouble for being wrong, and fired for lying. Scientists, their whole business is error correction. Snopes, it’s basically their mission statement. Academia, some professors are full of shit, but by and large they exist to seek knowledge. Therefore conservatives hate them all.
