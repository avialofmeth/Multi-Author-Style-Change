Schools often don't realise that it is an intrusion as Santa is not a proper saint of any kind and nor he part of many people's Christmas (is just that most commercial stuff uses him or started to use him only for commercial reasons which makes them money out of Christmas ... Just think of how Santa in red clothes is from Coca Cola adds not from the original looks).
