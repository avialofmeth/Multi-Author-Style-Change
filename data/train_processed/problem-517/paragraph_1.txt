Racism in Peru is as old as the country yet people like him can become president. I don’t agree with the article as it turn the attention to “race”, typical view for an American audience. Cry injustice and race, what about the crimes?? Did he commit these as an act of revenge and to get glance at a society that judged him for being of poor origins?? No, he granted contract with millions of dollars on paybacks, he hired immediate family in high government posts, collided with known terrorist, individuals who were sentenced and wanted by the law way before he started his term. The article is missing the fact that he was not a graduated teacher but someone who adopted teaching and use it to be part of its leftist faction .
