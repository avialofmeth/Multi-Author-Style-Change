Oh so I'm a misogynist because I don't appreciate some random tool barging in and spouting some of the most annoying rhetoric on this website? Are you that insecure that you immediately result to calling someone a misogynist whenever your fragile, shitty talking points aren't appreciated? Oh I apologize, I guess I'm "mansplaining" to you right now. I can't wait to be brought up in some 12,000 word manifesto posted to r/TwoXChromosomes about how men on this website are so horrible and never treat women with the respect they deserve.
