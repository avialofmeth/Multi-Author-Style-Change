Fair (I'm not young to drive into political analysis for win/loss). Although South Korea and US were still pretty big players in 2010-2016+. Almost all of those companies have had to shut down. Even LG gave up. If us had properly incentivized the industry, we would have both higher quality and better support. China had the incentive to invest in it as well because of its lack of other fuel sources. There was no reason for US to lose on the Li-FePO4 batteries. Trumps approach to creating trade wars by muscling into tariffs wasn't very effective either. Let's see how this one goes. Biden seems promising in the sense that he is looking at it from a standpoint of incentivizing and using tariffs to bring industry back to the US rather than going to a war over trade. Time will tell.
