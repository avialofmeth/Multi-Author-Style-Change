Had a Russian dude like that in my EET classes. Guy scoffed that his RU certifications weren't recognized, then proceeded to cheat his ass off from the first mother fucking term. I even had an instructor approach me to see if I knew that he was cheating off me. Oh - and then he proceeded to get kicked out of an unpaid internship with a local hospital.
