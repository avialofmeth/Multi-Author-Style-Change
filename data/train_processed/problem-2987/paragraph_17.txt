My point here is that we need to make some meaningful investments and actions (legislation, education, etc.) to get green energy going. You brought up good points about the green ammonia, which I find really neat, but I still feel that we just are not meeting the mark to put that middle finger up to gas/oil. Also for transportation we are seeing more electrically powered vehicles and an infrastructure that supports them being built. It’s not being done fast enough, but that’s where we are. To get that middle finger, we could be doing so much more.
