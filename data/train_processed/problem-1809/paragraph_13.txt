The point being, undoing the reestablishment of Israel is not a feasible option. While many are trying to come up with realistic solutions to create a lasting and just solution, complaining about 1948 does absolutely nothing. Anti-Zionists need to drill this in their heads: violence against Israel hasn't worked, boycotts against Israel have not worked, and social activism against Israel has not worked. If you are serious about a just solution, recognize and accept that Israel is not going anywhere and work towards peace.
