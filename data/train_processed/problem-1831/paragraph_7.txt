For politicians it’s a different can of worms. Mainly, IMO, that founders considered voting bad pols out to be primary remedy- doesn’t work when one party is wholly immune to facts like Republicans have become. Also, impeachment doesn’t work when half the political body is compromised and heavily partisan to the exclusion of all ethics. We’ve seen that the GOP is wholly opposed to any accountability for the criminals and other bad actors within their ranks.
