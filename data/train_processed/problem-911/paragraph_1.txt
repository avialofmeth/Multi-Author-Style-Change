I remember when the movie came out. A very mainstream magazine (I believe Life, but I’m not positive) had an article/photo spread on the movie. The issue of the nudity of a very young girl was raised (I don’t believe this nudity of the boy was even questioned) but it wasn’t really condemned. It was presented more as an example of Europeans being more open to sexuality than prudish Americans. The movie was seen as “daring” or “ edgy” but I don’t remember there being any real outrage over it. No effort to ban it or anything. I remember the article because I remembered Olivia. I was really hoping I would see more of her in a movie more interesting than Shakespeare. Times were really different then. There was plenty of opposition to nudity and explicit sex; probably more than now, but I recall much in the way of “ age of consent” issues.
