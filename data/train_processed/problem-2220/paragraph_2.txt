secondly: you're assuming flat-space, which works in a graph, on paper, but that's an assumption. there's a whole range of options for non-euclidean space, and general relativity itself shows that straight lines can end up curved. gravity itself, is just the tendency for objects to move in a straight line across/through our curved space.
