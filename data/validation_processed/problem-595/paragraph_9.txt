Interesting - however, IIRC it was China that ultimately backed off in the 2017 confrontation when India showed it was ready to go to war even if it meant losing. China thought India would just cave. A potential alliance between India and other countries (something India has typically rejected since independence due to its non-alignment and desire to be unencumbered in foreign policy) would really threaten China. Thatâ€™s why the Quad (US + Japan + Aus + Hopefully India) is so important, and should be the US priority in the region.
