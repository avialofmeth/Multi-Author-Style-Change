I'm going to make a different prediction than these gloom and doom headlines. I think qanon, et al coming back to twitter will only hasten its end. There is a reason the "free speech" platforms aren't viable and it isn't because someone can't build them properly. It's because advertisers do not want their products next to racist or extremist content. I saw somewhere that half of advertising dollars to twitter have already been at least paused. This is not the kind of decision that will bring them back. Now I know Elon is worth something like 160b but almost none of that is liquid. Is he really going to burn Tesla up to keep twitter alive?
