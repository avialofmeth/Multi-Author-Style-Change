But Iâ€™m joking about how it was done. Trump has claimed that the classified documents he held at MAL were declassified, by him, in his brain, the moment he took them from the White House. This is obviously not how it works, but if anyone ever wanted to actually try to enforce the Emoluments Clause, this would almost certainly be a part of his many, many assertions about the gifts and money he received in office.
