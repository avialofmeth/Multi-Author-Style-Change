Article is hidden behind a paywall, but is there an explanation for why he did this? I had a buddy that used to take an ambien before boarding a transcon flight (LAX-JFK for example) because he would fall asleep while taxiing and wake up at landing feeling completely refreshed. He did this for a couple years until a bad instance of somnambulism (sleep walking) had his waking up to being taken down by an air marshal because he stood up in the aisle and started taking his clothes off. He was able to explain himself out of jail and an airline ban but was humiliating enough to swear him off from the practice since.
