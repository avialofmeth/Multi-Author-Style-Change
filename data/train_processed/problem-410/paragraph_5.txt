in OR it's by design. the state assumes fraud with every application. Just about everyone I know here that was eligible had ended up waiting 2-3 months for their claims to be processed. and that's after waiting on hold for hours and hours. meanwhile everyone i know i NY that applied started getting money within 2-3 weeks. I was denied twice in OR and there was no real appeals process. at least not one that was reasonable.
