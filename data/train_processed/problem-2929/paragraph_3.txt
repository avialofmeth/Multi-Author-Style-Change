I live just along the border of one of the regions listed as a place where people eat cats as a holiday delicacy, and again, this is something I have never seen or heard, in stories or in restaurant menus. My wife even comes from this region in Switzerland. She is unaware of any traditional pet eating for Christmas. Dog sausages is something I have similarly never experienced. I grew up on a farm, we never ate pets. I don't know a single Swiss that actually knows a person that has. Maybe people used dog fat for rheumatism in the middle ages or something, but today you go to the doctor and pharmacy like everywhere else in Europe.
