I've heard the stories about how he supposedly gave them each a house, a plot of land to farm for themselves, taught them to read, and of course only beat them if they "deserved it for stealing and such" and how "it was a mercy" compared to how some slaves were treated. He went to war and fought against his cousins to protect that farm and when the slaves were freed he just hired them on and for years after their families and my family were just the best of friends.
