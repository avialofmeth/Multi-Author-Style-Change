A pilot ejection actually ridiculously costly, but not for the reason you would think of. Sure the plane is expensive, but the real cost is the loss of the pilot. Pilots only get a certain number of ejections before they’re grounded (if it’s not the first ejection it’s the second). It has to do with the massive forces an ejection does to your spine. And airworthy pilots are by far the most valuable and difficult to replace part of any Air Force.
