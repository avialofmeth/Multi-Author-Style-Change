I had posted this elsewhere. They try to frame it as people don't want to work but where I live in one of the top 25 most populous cities in the US, people have been priced out of the area. A recent report showed there was not a single apartment in the city that a person making $15 an hour could qualify to rent (30% of income rule) and many places just pay minimum wage or even less for restaurant workers. It's hard to fill positions when the wages paid will not allow you to live in the area.
