I hope you're right, but I fear you aren't. Politics is a pendulum. Swinging back and forth between each side before settling near the center. At least until given a push in one way or the other. For what ever reason it is pushed right for a lot of this country easier than it is pushed left. I mean, literal treason wasn't enough. They had to over turn Roe before there was push to the left. All it took to push it right was a NY "billionaire" behaving like a redneck.
