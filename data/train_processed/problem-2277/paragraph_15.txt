I genuinely haven’t read this story as a cock up on anyone’s part except perhaps China’s, and even then I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that they’re telling the truth and the craft is somehow technically “private” as they said. I mean we use private contractors for government jobs all the time, I’d think it would be pretty easy for China to outsource even spy work considering the power they have over companies that operate there.
