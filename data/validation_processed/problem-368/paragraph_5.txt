Your English is fine. It's hard to explain but it's like if Germans are famous for being being on time, drinking beer, and eating sausage. If you said one of those things "I always try to be on time" it would be normal, but if you say all three in the same sentence "I like to be on time, drink beer and eat sausage". The German might wonder if you are joking around and teasing them. You just said a few very common reddit things together .
