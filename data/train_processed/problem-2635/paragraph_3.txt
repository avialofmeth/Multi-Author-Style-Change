The first video has a heart-warming bit at the 0:19 mark where a soldier runs to his grandmother's home in Kherson and they share a tearful hug. In much of the second video, journalist Nic Robertson is with people in the city center of Kherson as they celebrate their liberation. He keeps asking them what it was like to be under Russian occupation, like he keeps probing for stories about awful things the Russians did. The residents who are joyful at their newfound freedom keep giving answers like, "we were hopeful our guys would come." Of course there's no shortage of crimes against the people of Kherson that are coming to light: kidnappings, torture rooms... And public facilities rigged with explosives.
