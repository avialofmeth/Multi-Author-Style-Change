Twitter, by contrast, is not a publicly traded company, but rather is owned by one person who doesn't answer to anyone, so he can do whatever he wants with it. It may end up costing him billions of dollars personally to run it the way he is, as advertisers flee under pressure from the general public, but nobody can fire him for costing the company all that money cause it's his money.
