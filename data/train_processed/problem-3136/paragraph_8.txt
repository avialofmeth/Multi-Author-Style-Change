For concealed carry. The Bruen case was about concealed carry and I believe the case upheld permits for public concealed carry which I can see but the difference between permit to simply buy/own and permit to publicly carry are different enough that I think Buren would uphold carry permits but not purchase permits. But I very easily could be allowing my personal biases to color my judgement on that.
