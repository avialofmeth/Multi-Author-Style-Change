Even before the ban, Canada had significant hurdles to obtaining a handgun. The stats reflect that (and not the ban). We also ban (most?) semi automatic rifles as I recall and have some hard caps on magazine sizes. Just check weapons used on various US school shootings and they are generally illegal or heavily restricted (like handguns) in Canada.
