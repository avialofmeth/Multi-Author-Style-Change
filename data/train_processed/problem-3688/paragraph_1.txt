Marjorie Taylor Greene is a disgrace and she's putting on full display just how far out of touch with reality the extreme right-wing has become. It's one thing to disagree with presidents of different political parties, but accusing them of treasonous behavior is beyond the pale. To be blunt, it almost seems like she's trying to pander to her base in the most unhinged way possible. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous and needs to be rejected by people across the political spectrum. MTGResign.
