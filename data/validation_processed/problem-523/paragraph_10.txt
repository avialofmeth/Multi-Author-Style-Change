If they can find jobs, let them work...our immigration policy is absolutely insane. White people do not own this land, and our Constitution is suppose to protect all law-abiding people. But when you literally make it illegal to even be in the country, what the hell are people suppose to do? They're coming in for the same reason our own immigrant ancestors did: for better opportunities.
