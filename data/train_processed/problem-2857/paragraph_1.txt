On /r/worldnews we mostly have pro-Russian / pro-Erdogan / pro-CCP astroturfers. A few years back Iran had surprising influence as well. They don't have the numbers to significantly influence votes of the top posts, but scroll a bit down and you'll often see them having great impact. This is especially true for issues fewer people care about, where they don't get much pushback from real users and can easily form the narrative, just look at pretty much any post that deals with China as an example.
