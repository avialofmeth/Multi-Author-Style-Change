Cool... can a Nigerian just board a plane for the cost of a bus ticket, take a plane ride to London and just enter visa free to take a look at their OWN HISTORY? Those aren't just "some statues". The rulers of Benin commissioned them after any significant event in their history. So instead of history books, their history is "written" within those statues.
