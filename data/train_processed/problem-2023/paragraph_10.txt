Anything is possible in a democracy if we had the collective will. We banned CFC’s and started to repair a gigantic hole in the ozone layer back in the 70s and 80s. We were under capitalism then. We boycotted South Africa and helped to end apartheid in the 80s. We ended the majority of child labor and putting people in the poor house and built a social safety net out of nothing. We have done the hard things before and capitalism doesn’t need to be a constant excuse to why we keep failing. This defeatist attitude makes it easy for companies and consumers to keep doing the wrong thing.
