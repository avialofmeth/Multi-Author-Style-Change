The alternative was a President who had just tried to provoke a war by assassinating an Iranian general, and we got lucky Iran didn't retaliate. So this isn't quite the dunk you thought it was if you intended it to be that way. I'm sure you're aware that the war in Iraq was popular at the time though and that people's opinions can change over time and with access to new information so I'm sure you weren't trying to dunk.
