People blame guns a lot, and sure we should have universal background checks to get guns, but it's far more than just easier access to guns that's the problem. We have far higher knife murder rates than other first world countries as well, and it's not access to guns that increases knife murders. If you really want to reduce gun crime, you need to address poverty and draconian drug laws since it's huge root cause of crime in the first place. If we had more social welfare lifting children out of poverty we'd have far lower violent crime rates. If we legalized and regulated drugs we'd have far less gang violence. If we improved our education system we'd have less violent crime and also less homelessness. Addressing income inequality would reduce our mass shooting problem as well. Trying to change which guns mass shooters use is the least effective and also most politically controversial way to try to address gun violence and mass shootings. It just leads to Democrats losing political power and thus any ability to fix the actual root issues of gun violence.
