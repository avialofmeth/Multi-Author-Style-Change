The pricing of oil seems reasonable, however natural gas prices also fell in Europe. I think EU has stored some portion of the natural gas they bought from Russia, and they are using their reserves. They were supposed to economise and limit their usage, but they did not need to use gas as much as previous years due to the abnormal heat they have been experiencing this winter. Now, the EU must be increasing the supply of gas, hence the price drop.
