I saw an article on Yahoo last week about how a lot of families with LGBTQ+ children or parents were considering leaving Florida and the comments were really fucking depressing. A lot of the top comments were saying things like they voted DeSantis by a large margin and they want these people to leave for California or Portland or other places conservatives hate. Terrible comments. I'm not spending any money in Florida while all of this is going on.
