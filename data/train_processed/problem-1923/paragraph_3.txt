>tight shot of old man with goatee in fatigues sitting on the floor with his head plastic wrapped to a rigid post on his left face. he says a speech and a sledgehammer comes swinging into frame and hits his jaw right where the hinge is. no blood, no deformation and the impact knocks him out of the plastic wrap and he falls back (shot is low and from the feet. can only see his goatee over his chest). Then there is one more downward blow and no blood. then the video ends.<.
