And the only reason that the 3 power plaza invasion was possible is due to weird lacking of security personnel. There is a current investigation on why there where so few security people there, on where each side accuses the other of omission. The government says that there are too many "Bolsonaristas" on the security forces that were lenient with the protester, and the opposition accuses the government to purposely let a small security personnel on that day to ease the invasion and pose themselves as victims.
