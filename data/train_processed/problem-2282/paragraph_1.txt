But what he’s doing here is (1) calling their bluff, and (2) playing “good cop” which is what France’s role almost always is with Russia and China. He’s basically telling China - “You want to end the war? Great. So do we. Go tell Russia to stop attacking Ukraine, and the war will be over and you will have helped the West.” Everyone knows China can’t do that, so… calling the bluff. It’s a smart strategy, and closer to what Ukraine itself is doing, because it’s a win/win. Either China doesn’t stop Russia, in which case China been called out for their hypocrisy on the world stage, or somehow they achieve the impossible and get Russia to pull out of Ukraine, pay reparations etc.
