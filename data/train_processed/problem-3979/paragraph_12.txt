The stories they tell about my however many greats grandfather are almost completely, if not entirely, made up. Truth is, or at least as close to the truth as I've managed to dig, after the war he said that they could continue to live in on his property and continue on basically business as usual except he paid them a pittance so they were forced to continue working for him or be homeless. From what I can gather he was an evil man. The stories I've managed to dig up about him talk more about an abusive husband and father than a benevolent farmer. My grandmother has let slip that her mother told her it wasn't unusual for him to pull out a whip on his kids so I can't imagine the slaves working the field were treated any better.
