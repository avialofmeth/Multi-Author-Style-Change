The US was almost certainly running a counter-intel operation against it. Probably not jamming per se as that might cause issues with critical infrastructure depending on what signals it was transmitting. But I think, with a reasonably high degree of certainty, that the US was trying to figure out what sort of information it was collecting and where it was sending it with SIGINT assets (both COMINT and ELINT) of our own. And there's probably a related HUMINT operation underway, too. And I have no doubt any other country in this situation would do the same.
