Not intending to make this personal, but I think it’s incredibly unethical to cling to one collective improvement in the midst of a mass extinction. I’ll avoid the science behind why this win was possible and others unlikely. Part of the reason we’re in this mess is that the electorate, once it found out it was systematically lied to in the 70s, is still far too tied to BAU.
