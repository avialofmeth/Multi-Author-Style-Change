My worry is actually that Zelenskyi will dispute their war crimes, which Putin will love since it now has become a dispute, and he can muddy the waters, which has been always his political tool. Zelenskyi should say yes, we take all war crime incidents seriously --> what is Russia going to say about the systematic torture, rape, abductions and civilian deaths?
