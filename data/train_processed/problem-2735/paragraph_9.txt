I think my favourite part of this entire debacle was when Richard Fadden, proclaimed as "Trudeau National security advisor" by the news organizations covering this claimed that we should have a public inquiry. I guess were supposed to ignore the fact he wasn't a Trudeau appointed advisor, he was Harpers and he was already disliked heavily by liberals prior to his resignation, a whole 4 months into Trudeau's term.
