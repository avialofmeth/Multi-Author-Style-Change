Fair, but if I start stumbling my explanation and someone else could explain it better, I wouldn't be upset. Now if the guy comes back and tells me I misunderstood him and I got what he was saying wrong, fair is fair, my mistake. However his intention is very clear in his comment, so I am confident that I got to what he was trying to get at.
