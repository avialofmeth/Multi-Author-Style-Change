Respectability politics in this sense means the ostracization of people deemed to act unrespectable. Not be respectful and strike a moderate tenor. It was a big part of the war on drugs and mass-incarceration. Harm reduction and social structures weren't seriously considered by Black leaders of this time period because they were focus on ridding their communities of people they believed gave the communities a bad rap. They didn't want the Black community to be associated with drug users within the community. That the negative stereotypes about the Black community could be countered by very paternalistic moral policing to show the Black community in DC as refined and respectable.
