It was probably inevitable that Russian troops eventually learn from their mistakes and change their doctrine to reflect reality. For me the worry is that the "smart survivors" will pass on their experience to a large amount of mobilized troops that may overwhelm Ukraine eventually just because of the sheer numbers they could muster. But that's still far in the future, if at all. And so far, it seems that for the time being, no large-scale mobilization, part 2 is going on.
