(/s anyone who wants to indoctrinate and erase cultures with forced education can go bury themselves in arrogance. No I'm not saying we should let China erase cultures. In fact the point I'd like to make is that these nations previously got away with it and I would bet China will get away with it even today, considering Tibet tried and failed at being sovereign when Maoist China took over, aka not many nations in the world recognize Tibet as independent so China can use that excuse to do whatever. This sort of thing happens elsewhere too- Russia with um I forgot who exactly [not Ukraine, this is before they invaded], India with Kashmir, Israel and Palestine...).
