Europe has cut the dependency already and "the west" cannot dictate what the rest of the world does. A cap was already introduced so Russians unlikely are getting anything above that. Given that transportation, insurance, maintenance of the production infrastructure with blackmarket parts due to sanctions its likely their revenues are taking a big hit. Many western companies have left Russia as have many young professionals who had the ability to do so leaving Russian economy in a really unstable situation. Russia will likely soon have to resort to additional mobilisation and harnessing industries to keep the war going so it really does not look good even if they have lots of resources.
