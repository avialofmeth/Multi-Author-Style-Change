You can’t always tease out a justice’s position from oral arguments, but in this case quite a few of them seemed pretty hostile to the argument NC lawyer was making, with only Gorsuch and Alito being full throated in their support of a maximalist idea of the independent state legislature theory. Even Thomas didn’t seem all that enthused.
