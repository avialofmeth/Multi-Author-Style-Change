That said, the one thing I haven't heard of is women being forced yet. So does that go for women's prisons too? I think she's OK right now but Russia is absolutely desperate and I don't put it past them to empty those too soon. And maybe for roles like trench digging, medic help, idk. It's Russia, so u never know and don't hold your breath bc they don't do whats right - they just do what they want and what they think benefits them.
