Even the ‘stunning’ 2016 win was a squeaker, defined as losing the popular vote but winning the electoral college. And this against an unwisely chosen opponent. Clinton and Trump both polled at the all-time bottom for likability. The two worst candidates since they started asking that question. Against a normal-strenh Democrat, Trump loses. And, Clinton against an even average-likeable Republican doesn’t come as close as she did. 2016 was a very unusual setup that way.
