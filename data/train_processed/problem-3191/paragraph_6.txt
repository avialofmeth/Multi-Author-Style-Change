It's a matter of how Reichsb√ºrger pose a risk in terms of occasional violent acts, which is of course still a serious concern, but it's not an actual threat to the democratic order. Or put differently, imagine you had been planning to overthrow the government, already saw yourself as the future Reichsminister for Matters of Utmost Import, and the media doesn't even consider your attempted coup to have been important enough to make users' phones go "bing".
