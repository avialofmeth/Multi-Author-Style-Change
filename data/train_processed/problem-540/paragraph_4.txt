Also, I'd love to see it but I'm wondering how effective they will be. Even for more modern aircraft the airspace seems less than permissive.. In western doctrine you would have EW aircraft, supported by wild weasle sorties, CAP and so on to support strike missions. Yes they had some success flying HARMS of mig-29s but still. I hate to see get a bunch of pilots with limit flight hours immediately get shot down.
