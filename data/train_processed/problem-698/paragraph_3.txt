We also had another one in Canada yesterday and another in Montana, with reports from South America and Asia of sightings coming in too about Uap sightings. Montana was of such worry in fact they scrambled a bunch of jets and closed the air space for a while, and according to the senator of Montana the object is still there and they are waiting till this morning to shoot it down, according to the senator.
