I was working at an international tech company in 2015 and worked with a team in Russia while I was in California. That team was told they had to relocate to keep their jobs because they could not be trusted with sensitive information (that they needed to do their jobs) while they were within reach of a hypothetical Russian subpoena/warrant. They all moved to the EU.
