I mean one person can't run a gov't. Like he has to have some connect to the rest of the world somehow. I know he's got a bunker he stays in sometimes but someone has to at least bring him food. As time has gone on the side that agrees with him has gotten smaller and the side that thinks he's a fucking moron keeps getting bigger. What happens when the guy who puts gas in his diesel generator finally decides he's as stupid as everyone thinks?
