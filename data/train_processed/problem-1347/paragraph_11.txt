Again, currently the leaked and unverified claims of the lethal aid they are reported to be willing to provide are quite paltry for a country the size of China. So to me it seems more like a shot across the bow to the US and a placating gesture to the Russians. But under the right (or wrong, rather) circumstances this could escalate further. The last thing you want is further entrenchment on this issue between China and the EU/US, and while that currently is in neither blocs interest - situation with high tensions can be unpredictable.
