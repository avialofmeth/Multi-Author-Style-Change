However one of the Senate's rules is that a few spending bills ("budget reconciliation") cannot be filibustered. They can only do this a few times per year, and these bills can only have certain types of provisions. For example, it's not possible to do a marriage bill under budget reconciliation because it has nothing to do with taxing/spending.
