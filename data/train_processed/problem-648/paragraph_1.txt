I read yday that in some houses they occupy, they choose one room to poop in, even tho there’s a working bathroom. The toilet is shaped like a seat. The little lever shows you it flushes… I would be curious, what is their IQ on average? Wouldn’t even one person be smart enough to say, hey, let’s flush this stinky stuff away.
