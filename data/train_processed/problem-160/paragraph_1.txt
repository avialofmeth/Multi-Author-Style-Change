Your point about prolonging the war is a fallacy. Since Ukraine won’t surrender, arming them with specific kinds of tactical weapons systems they lack reduces their casualties and enables them to take their morale and manpower advantage and beat Russia back faster than would otherwise be possible. Also, the rest of the west is providing more basic kinds of things like winter clothes, small arms, field kitchen/heating/generator systems too. Much of it being organized and funded at a grassroots level. We’re doing what we can to stop a genocide in the least-morally-ambiguous major armed conflict in several generations.
