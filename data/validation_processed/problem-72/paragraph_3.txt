In China, the state plays a significant role in controlling the economy. The government sets economic policies and goals, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a major role in key industries such as energy, transportation, and heavy manufacturing. The government also regulates prices and foreign investment, and controls the flow of capital in and out of the country.
