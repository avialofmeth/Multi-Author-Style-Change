I keep thinking retroactively setting the interest rate at 0% would help way more people and by a bigger dollar amount. That way people can still pay back what they borrowed, but at least then the government wouldn't be in the business of profiting on the debt of American workers. Most people I know who still have student loan balance 10, 15 years after graduating have already more than paid back what they borrowed.
