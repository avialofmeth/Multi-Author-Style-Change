I don't think anyone should be blaming Nancy Pelosi for Democrats potentially losing the House. The Democratic House passed dozens or even hundreds of bills that people wanted. They all died in the Senate. Over her time, Pelosi reliably has gotten Democrats on board to vote for tons and tons of actual progressive Legislation. The problem is it dies in the Senate every time.
