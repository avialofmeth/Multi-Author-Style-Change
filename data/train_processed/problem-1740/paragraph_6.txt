My mother in law is a special Ed teacher in a tiny town out in the middle of nowhere. They had a trans kid who was treated wonderfully. But she was "one of theirs", so I don't think any greater lessons were learned. The entire community still votes republican. We'll see how they feel when "small government" comes for them.
