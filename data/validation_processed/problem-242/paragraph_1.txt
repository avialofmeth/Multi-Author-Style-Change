Samsung still has official stores open. LG is not just present in Russia, but actually creates new products exclusively for the Russian market. Apple devices are available to buy from authorized (actually authorized, Apple website links to them) resellers. EGS is the only non-russian game store that accepts Russian payment methods (including MIR cards I think). Twitch accepts money from russian payment services. You can buy Nvidia and AMD GPUs from partners because they still officially work in Russia. Not sure how official CPU shipments are, but all of them are available for MSRP (or close to it). For that matter, pretty much everything is available.
