I think in a lot of ways the Civil War never really ended. Less than a week after the surrender was signed at Appomattox, Lincoln was assassinated and reconstruction was ended shortly thereafter. We're still fighting the same racist assholes today, whether they're confederates, Nazis or just the current mainstream GOP, this fight against white supremacy never really stopped.
