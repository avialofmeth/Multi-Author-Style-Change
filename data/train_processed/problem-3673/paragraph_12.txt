For all the people who think the Democrats are the good guys here: if the Ds were really supportive of the workers they wouldn't have taken any of this up. They would have said, "You guys have a legitimate grievance. You have a legitimate tool - a strike- to make your point. If you need to strike, then strike. We've got your backs. We will not let our fears make us go against our commitment to workers.".
