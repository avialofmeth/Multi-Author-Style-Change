Any negotiations with the US would lend credence to Russian sentiment they are fighting everyone in the West. This is about Ukraine, and they need to negotiate a peace settlement as they see fit, when they see fit. Right now, they’re holding the Russians by their nose and kicking them in the ass. I don’t see Ukraine pressing for a settlement when they appear to be winning the war and want to press for Russia to leave all of the occupied territories.
