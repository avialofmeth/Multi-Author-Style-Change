Twitter is still relevant to people like me because the communities we belong to (Art Twitter, Black Twitter, Gaming and FGC Twitter, Software Development Twitter, Photography Twitter, Electronics Hobbyist Twitter, Skateboard Twitter) are still active there and we're not going to just drop it overnight, and unfortunately, most of them will never migrate to Mastodon.
