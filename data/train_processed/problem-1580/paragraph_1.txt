Imagine 800 bananas (which give off naturally occurring radiation) blended into an Olympic swimming pool. Now imagine that one pool dumped into the ocean. Yeah, near the outlet you might notice the raised radiation level but after 100 meters this falls to near background levels and less than you'd measure on a California beach with granite runoff.
