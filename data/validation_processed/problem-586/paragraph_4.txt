I've been reading up on the Dominion Brief and it's amazing how high Fox's legal risks are, and how it documents the kayfabe and their support of it. For many of them I think it gets very hazy where kayfabe and crazy cross over. It has a lot in common with “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”.
