it was the conscripts that got 2 weeks of training - almost zero weapons practice and mostly trained how to build trenches and sandbag walls, given a shovel , pistol and 60s era heavy machine guns which are actually crew weapons. So heavy it takes 2-3 men to transport and set up and their vehicles so low on fuel they weren't allowed to use them to transport the heavy guns around . Conscripts were sent to front lines mostly to try to secure defensive positions while the regulars and mercs push forward. But conscripts started to get completely rolled . Which cut off supply chains to regulars . Really bad planning . Large amount of conscripts just surrender positions or themselves immediately because they were also told they would be shot or jailed for retreating.
