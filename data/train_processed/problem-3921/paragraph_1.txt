Which would sound pretty good... except, when they say "family values" they mean "traditional family" aka nuclear heterosexual family. So they're against things like same-sex marriage because, in their view, it's somehow an insult or a threat to "real families". And they're usually also against decriminalising drugs, because they perceive everything from this protectionist "think of the children!" angle.
