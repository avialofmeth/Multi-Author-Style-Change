It’s a delicate dance bc the various factions (GRU, MOD, Airbourne Forces, FSB, Rosgvardia, Internal Affairs, etc.) have got to on the one hand say they need more money in order to complete whatever mission, while at the same time say Putin handing over more money doesn’t show that they’ve been incompetent up till that point. Since it’s difficult to balance that message, all the agencies actively sabotage the others. In order for others to appear more incompetent, or to say we can come in and do a better job.
