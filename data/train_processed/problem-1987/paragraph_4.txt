At my institution, the new library dean is so toxic we've had numerous librarians quit. At least a handful of those abandoned academic librarianship altogether. I was in library IT as a sysadmin, and I joined the research computing team. People are getting tired of being treated like shit, yet the administration is so out of touch they'll just let their institutions fall apart instead of trying to repair things and make improvements.
