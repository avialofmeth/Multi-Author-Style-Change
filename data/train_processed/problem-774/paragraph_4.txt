Pretty much always needs to be at difference with Iran. So if Russia is going to send Iran a fuck ton of money for drones the Saudis are obviously going to see that as a red line and support the opposition. My prediction with this support is that whole oil fiasco we had over the summer has no chance of repeating with Saudis siding with Ukraine and at large the west.
