I just don’t understand why a guy arrested for armed robbery 10 miles south of the city would drive up to China town to beat up an old Asian person on the street at random and not even steal anything. And I don’t understand why that happened lots of times. And I don’t understand why it was happening constantly right before the election and literally hasn’t happened since then.
