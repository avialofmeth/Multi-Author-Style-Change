Absolutely more AD for Ukraine, Guv. Unfortunately the best AD systems are high end national infrastructure projects that don't just sprout like mushrooms. There are many elements to these systems that make them effective, and building them is kinda like a layer cake that increases effectiveness by building upon it's last iteration. It requires patience to get these systems built during a war. It is definitely something that would be better done during peacetime, but Ukraine doesn't have that luxury and time is also constrained. I believe Ukraine will get this system built as fast as circumstances allow.
