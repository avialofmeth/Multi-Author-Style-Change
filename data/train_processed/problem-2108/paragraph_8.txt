Not who you asked, but I believe that it is okay to communicate with people based on the way in which they themselves interpret reality. I personally default to what is basically agnostic, but I will often communicate with people through a biblical framework if I know that the Bible is part of their "vocabulary". A politicians faith or lack thereof doesn't really bother me one way or another, as I know very well that all humans inhabit a fictitious construct, and whether or not this construct contains a "God", while not entirely irrelevant, is not exactly the standard by which I feel a person should be judged.
