I can understand being gay and having traditional conservative values. Republicans do not have traditional conservative values, they have culture war propaganda and that’s pretty much it. So gay Republican just makes no sense whatsoever and I’d feel bad for them if the reality of the modern Republican Party wasn’t so easy to see.
