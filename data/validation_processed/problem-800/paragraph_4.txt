I understand what you're saying about the whole Germany might as well just join Russia hyperbole that has somehow been reached at times. However I personally believe a balance is needed. We can recognize that Germany has some weird questionable priorities and is a bureaucratic mess which moves far too slowly. And still admit that it's one of the best Nations in Europe and does lots of things right.
