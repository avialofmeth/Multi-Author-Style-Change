Typical American which knows nothing about football. Argentina is a contender to win the world cup. They have way more on the line to lose by losing the match than any bribe. This is also Messi's last worldcup and no amount of money would ever make him consider fixing the match since he already has more money than you could imagine. He wants to achieve a world cup victory with his country. So which is it, do you know nothing about football or are you just racist against Arabs.
