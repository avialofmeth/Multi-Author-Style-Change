Is that why Japan and Korea signed the RCEP deal along with China? Would you further integrate your economy with someone you see as a sworn enemy? Japan and Korea will not cross any line unless China does first, China hasn’t even gone towards Taiwan yet. I wouldn’t expect any hard help from japan or Korea unless they are directly hit by something.
