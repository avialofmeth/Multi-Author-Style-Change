I say this as a former Republican and current Democrat. The fact that Romney terrified you on election night reflects poorly on how both parties use fear and not debate. Romney is a decent man that has some economic views that favor wealth over populace as his worst public quality. That he was made out as a terrifying figure speaks to the brokenness of US politics in the same way Republicans are terrified of Biden. Both men are consensus seeking moderates which should be accepted by the other side post election as legitimate leaders until proven wrong.
