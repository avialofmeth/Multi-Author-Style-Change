Sometimes you don't realize what's wrong until someone points it out. Using ears as an example, I've needed to get my ears flushed out before, because through the regular use of earbuds and having a fear of sticking stuff in my ear to clean them (plus at the time I didn't know better), I managed to get massive balls of ear wax piled into my ear to the point where it couldn't fall out naturally. I wasn't noticing any difficulties in hearing, and in fact my hearing was quite good. I also didn't feel anything wrong. But the difference it made when the doctor finally flushed my ears, and being able to hear very nuanced differences in quiet sounds, was amazing.
