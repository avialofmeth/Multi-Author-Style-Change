Basically they're off the hook for most emissions because even though they literally make their money from end customers combusting the products and generating GHGs, all of that is lumped under scope 3 and so only indirectly within their influence. There's a fair bit of noise about scope 3 emissions now, but a few years ago people didn't really bother about estimating them as much (it was all about direct emissions and emissions from purchased heat/electricity).
