Out of the 4 that Nixon appointed, only 2 did what he wanted . One of them turned into the most liberal justice ever in Blackmun. Powell was a moderate centrist who proved to be more liberal as Brennan continued to influence him. Also, as progressive as the Warren court was, it also gave Nixon a free victory as he was able to turn the peoples anger about crime into votes and honestly, deservedly so. The Warren Court was great but some of its decisions were not very good(parts of Miranda come into mind). They were ruling in favor of criminal defendents every time. Not a great look.
