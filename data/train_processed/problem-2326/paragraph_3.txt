The thing that Republicans don't get about Democrats (and everyone else who isn't an asshole): We actually want it to be OK for a Republican politician to dress in drag The problem we have is when they dress in drag then turn around and marginalize and criminalize others who do so. It isn't the drag that's offensive or shameful - it's the hypocrisy.
