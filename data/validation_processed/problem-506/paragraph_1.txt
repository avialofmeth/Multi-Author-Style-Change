except thanks to HIMARS that had kinda been neutralized quite some time ago. Since HIMARS outranges Russian batteries. Ukraine opens up on mobniks, Russia returns fire, maybe the Ukranian artillery is damaged by a lucky shot instead of an inaccurate shell from a worn out Russian barrel, but a nearby HIMARS will counter fire and eliminate the Russian artillery anyway.
