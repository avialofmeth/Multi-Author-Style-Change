True. But, there's a little more to the difference. North Korea is still just a little piss-ant country with a nut in charge. Yes, they have more of a military than that would normally suggest, and they have the potential for actual nuclear capabilities; but, they have little else. They have no position or even a history of a position at the table with the rest of the world as a player on any front other than as a loud mouthed little bully shouting from the sidelines.
