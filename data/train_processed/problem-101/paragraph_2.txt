According to the article, the US is accusing NK of supplying Russia with artillery shells. NK has thousands of artillery pieces pointed at Seoul, and puts a lot of funding into their military at the expense of their own people. I wouldn't put it past them selling or trading artillery shells, especially if it's older stock.
