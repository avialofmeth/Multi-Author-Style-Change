Started thinking about it, and while it might speak to geographic ignorance to talk of a "civil war next door" like that, and good chance it is, the distance from Cambodia to Myanmar is about from the west coast to only as far as Montana/Wyoming/Colorado/New Mexico in the US. The chunk from the coast to there is only a third of the whole country.
