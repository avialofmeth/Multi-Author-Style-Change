It's nowhere near as bad. If they're from his time as vice president, the National Archives obviously didn't know they were even missing and he wasn't trying to prevent their return. Trump basically ignored the NA informing him they were missing documents and asked form then to be returned and Trump basically refused to cooperate to the point his home was raided. Biden has been fully cooperating and he/his staff had previously found documents and returned them on their own.
