I've been told multiple times that there needs to be a bipartisan coalition of at least 35 states to enact constitutional reform in regards to nationwide gun control including policing and that the most successful measures are carried out on a state or local level. Is that accurate? If it is, I think it provides some context as to why very little has been tried by the president. Or congress. There may not be as much they can practically do as compared to a more local level?
