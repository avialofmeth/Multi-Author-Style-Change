Let me dust off that irony for you, your logic that there isn't any evidence that point to religion pre bronze age, so applying logical conclusion that came from Observing like 99.99% of human societies that formed since we figured out how to communicate ( and still apply to this day ) is somehow more full of shit than filling that void of knowledge ( more like a lack of physical evidence of something that can't be proven without the ability to communicate like faith but i digress) with what ? Your own bullshit that the only thing close to a rational thought is " we don't know, i have no way to refute your claim with sound logic and evidence but i am right and you are wrong".....like are you for real ?
