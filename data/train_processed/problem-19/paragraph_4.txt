Technically speaking there are norms follow even in wartime, with the implicit understanding that if you pass a point it's open season. Some of these norms make sense: an attempted assassination means it is now 100% legitimate to try it yourself, and when you're trying to negotiate with the other party it's usually a good idea to keep the head of the snake intact while the tails fight so they can negotiate in (alleged) good faith.
