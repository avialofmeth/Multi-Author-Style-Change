But the law right now is completly unconstitutional as written. It is essentially a full ban on gun sales. All firearm sales need a permit, but there was no provision for time to set that up, or a budget for it. We need him control, but this law was possibly the worst execution of it. It is so bad I was thinking someone on the far right wrote it knowing it wouldn't pass, and if it did the court would stop it. But they did something for gun control.
