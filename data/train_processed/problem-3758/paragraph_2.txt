Religious organizations, for all their faults, are usually out to look after themselves, or whatever fucked up dogma they've created in their own heads from reading their religious texts. I think the Orthodox church in Russia is a little different, in that in Soviet times it was mostly just another arm of the KGB. I would assume that the church is very much still in cahoots with the government, and security services. Especially as the Patriarch is ex KGB himself.
