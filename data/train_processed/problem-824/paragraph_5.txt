Well, she was one of the last ones. The state was blue, then purple, now red. Missouri has had plenty of Democratic senators and governors. The Republicans now do well there by using ballot initiatives to keep liberal policies or add liberal policies. Most recent being recreation marijuana use. That would never have passed the Missouri congress. The Republicans can go back to their conservative constituents and say “we had nothing to do with this.” Along with gerrymandering, and slashing education it’s going to be a red state for a long time. “You don’t want to vote Democrat and be like St. Louis do you??” I think someone can beat Josh Howley but it’s probably can only be a moderate democrat or he loses in the Republican primary to a moderate Republican. Like if Danforth has a kid or someone like that.
