I know a lot of folks that Identify as Iranian simply because their culture is still distinct from Persian. Some cultures are precursors that had lived in the region prior to the Achaemenid. Persian kings of antiquity have been known to bring artisans and scholars of other cultures, settling their people within classical Persia. For example, Assyrians are a minority group in Iran, but they have a fantastically long history in the region going back to 2500BC. The Sasanian Dynasty brought Armenian craftsman to Persia after the conquest of Armenia. Likewise, Persian Jews have been in Iran since the Babylonians.
