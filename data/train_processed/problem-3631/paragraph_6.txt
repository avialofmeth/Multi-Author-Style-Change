Did the popular vote represent a 6:1 ratio? I feel like no one ever talks about this when discussing gerrymandering cases. The districts should reflect the popular vote (at least the prior one). If this was codified into law it would also incentivize people who live in safe opposing party districts to go out and vote anyway and boost their party's popular vote tally.
