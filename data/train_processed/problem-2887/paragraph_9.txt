I don't disagree at all. But what I'm talking about is people's disconnect on the realities of certain things. People seem to think Ukraine is absolutely shit stomping Russia and not taking losses in the process. While that's partially true, they have done an absolutely monumental job so far, no one knows the severity of loss the Ukrainian military has suffered in the process. And sadly it's probably pretty high with the amount of artillery, mines and missiles that have been dumped into that country.
