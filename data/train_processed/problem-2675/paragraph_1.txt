Reminds me of djt lying about the employment rate before the 2015 election. He said it was 30 or 40%. That the Dept of Labor was laying to us about Obama’s numbers (5-6%). Then, the numbers came out during his first week in office. Sean Spicer announced the rate was 5.something %. When challenged by the press as to the discrepancy between djt’s numbers and the real numbers given how improbable it would be to go from 40% to 5% in a week, Sean smiled acknowledging the farce and affirmed the Labor’s numbers were accurate.
