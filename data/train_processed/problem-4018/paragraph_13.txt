You're correct, but not in the way you think. It would be an easy place for hackers, especially state sponsored hackers, when everything is centralized like that. This is basically the SuperBowl or World Cup of hacking trophies. Don't know if you've noticed, but the globe isn't exactly hugging their differences out. Not a good idea. Let alone all the other issues this raises.
