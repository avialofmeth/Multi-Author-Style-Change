Pakistan has used the billions in US aid for "fighting terrorists" if by fighting you mean funding terror camps. Their army has always engaged in proxy warfare by sending terrorists across the border. The shit got so out of hand they don't even listen to Pak anymore and hence in last 20 years there are countless bombings in Pak- and yet US doesn't stop the multi billion aid. Trump did it but I believe Biden restarted it.
