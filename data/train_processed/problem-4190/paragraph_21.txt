In my own case, FL spent a month not telling me they were now requiring me to usd ID.me, then gave me the wrong link, then sent me a broken link, then I was finally able to submit an application... which somehow dodn't go through for months with none of my 9 separate communications ever (to this day )being answered by ID.me.
