Some ask: "how long can the west keep supporting Ukraine?". It's not just Ukraine they're supporting, they're defending themselves by keeping Russia at bay as strategically as possible. If Ukraine loses, the whole of Europe and US loses. It's not about if they can keep affording to fund and support Ukraine, it's that they can't afford NOT TO.
