Seems to me that the GOP, unlike Democrats, has taken on working class and has been working extra hard to appear supportive of our miserly issues. Lately they've been making great strides in coopting language pertaining to blue collar workers. They appear to be practically progressive, minus the legislation. But the very same can be said of the Democratic Party that expresses sympathy with the working class yet fails in any way to depart from neoliberal policies it keeps on reviving and pushing along.
