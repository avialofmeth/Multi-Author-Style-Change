That being said, I think Sanders is more valuable in the Senate than he would be in the White House. The governor of Vermont is a Republican and Vermont has no law saying that he must appoint someone from Sanders's party if he leaves his seat early (not that it would mean much, because Sanders won as an Independent, not a Democrat).
