I've been making my GTFO of Texas plan and Minneapolis is on my list with Chicago, Denver, the Northeast, and the west coast for placea to look at. My only real concern is that I've heard people are generally pretty closed off insofar as they have their established friend grounds so it's hard to make friends as a transplant.
