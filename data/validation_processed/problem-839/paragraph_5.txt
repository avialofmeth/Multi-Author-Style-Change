It sucks that they indoctrinate their children from nearly birth with hatred (this is a fact - Google examples such as what’s in their textbooks if you don’t believe me // Bourdain also highlighted it when he visited). It definitely makes it hard to have peace when you have a very angry, young, and ignorant crowd.
