"Latinos" are a massively varied population. So expecting the same political alignment from a diverse group is kinda silly anyways. You also need to consider generational entrenchment. A newly immigrated mom from Gautemala is going to have a vastly different set of priorities than a second generation Mexican father with 3 kids in college and a mortgage. Plus the longer you're here, the more "fuck you I got mine" they may get.
