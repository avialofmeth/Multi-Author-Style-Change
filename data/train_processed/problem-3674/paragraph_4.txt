Party politics definitely matters for some things, but when it comes to how the US acts in the Middle East and North Africa... there is less of a distinction. I think the last time there was real policy divergence was probably under the Bush (W) admin, where I think a Democrat in the same position would have been unlikely to invade Iraq. The drone program for example has been equally popular under Republican and Democrat administrations, and has only ever increased over time.
