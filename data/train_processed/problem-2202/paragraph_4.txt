Yes, my wife has had three children. Had we not miraculously got the medical attention we needed seemingly by chance for the last one, there was a good chance both mother and baby would be dead (a chance comment during a routine appointment made the doctor do an ultrasound, revealing a placental abruption, requiring an immediate caesarian - otherwise baby and possibly mother would die).
