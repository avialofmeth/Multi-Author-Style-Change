A number of potential reasons. Maybe the Canaanite language has a single word for "hair on the head + facial hair", they may have more compact verbs (e.g. a single word for "root out"), they may not use articles (no "the" equivalents), they may use a case system to distinguish "this tusk" rather than having two separate words, etc. etc.
