I have the same philosophy — all your relationships (except possibly your kids) should be transactional. If you’re getting nothing out of any relationship (friend, business, partner) it’s time to leave or try to fix it—you’ll be happier for it. What you get out of a relationship might be something intangible — but you should get something.
