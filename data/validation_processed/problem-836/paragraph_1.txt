I would love if my country/region/local government would get on board with helping. The examples I have seen fail to meet additionality criteria. I am pretty sure I would be pro-offset, pro-emission reduction, and if it can work: pro-sequestration/capture/removal. But what I believe the UN is trying to move folks away from are essentially greenwashing campaigns.
