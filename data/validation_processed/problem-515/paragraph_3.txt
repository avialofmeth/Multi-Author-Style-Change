Meanwhile they appoint and award all the top level managers, VPs, etc, whilst us, who actually are boots on the ground DOING the work are largely ignored, never consulted, and pegged into lower level positions with no chance for advancement. Are told we should consider ourselves lucky we have our jobs, though WE are the cogs that keep the machine rolling and actually CARE about our students. It's quite frustrating.
