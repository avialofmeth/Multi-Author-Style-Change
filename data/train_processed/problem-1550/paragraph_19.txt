Your vice chancellor appears to have been full of shit, just like Germany was wishy-washy about what it would supply earlier on. Again I appreciate that Germany has sent a lot of stuff, but it's communication and lack of leadership on this issue when it comes to it's own manufactured arms is understandably infuriating.
