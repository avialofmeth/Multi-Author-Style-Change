It was not at a scrapyard. One of the thieves brought the capsule home , they perforated it and saw a glowing material inside, behing stupid morons they invited other people to take a shot at cracking the capsule open thinking the stuff inside was valuable. They made a mess and a 6yo kid smeared some dust on themselves. Kid died mom died fucking idiot dad survived.
