They'd need a strong political unifying political opposition and support from a good portion of the army to do that. The alternative is to rush in weapons, give the Iranian state the excuse to indiscriminately torture, detain and execute suspected (and note I say suspected) members of the opposition. This opens a potential second front alongside Ukraine and risks a return to a more significant energy crisis than the recent one with less chance to source alternatives and greater potential for exploitation by those remaining alternative sources.
