An off-handed comment by General Mark Milley (who has consistently overestimated Russia, saying at the start of the invasion that Kyiv would fall in a few weeks), does not qualify as "according to US intelligence". US intelligence has never claimed that Ukraine and Russia are suffering 1:1 casualties, because they're not. Even Milley himself didn't mean that as any kind of serious analysis, hence the "probably".
