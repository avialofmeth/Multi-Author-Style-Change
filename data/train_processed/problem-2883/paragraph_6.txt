That's the problem all the 2024 contenders have. They are delusional if they think the majority of people who supported Trump in 2020 will move to them in a primary. Especially if Trump blames them for his loss based on their wishy washy support for his candidacy in 2020. Nothing but blind obedience is good for the cult and that's a litmus test GOP presidential candidates won't pass.
