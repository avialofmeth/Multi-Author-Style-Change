If a school wanted to charge $100K for a degree, but the government only gave $25K then the student would either have to come up with the other $75K or not go. It’d be that simple. If the school could operate like normal if student s decided to not go because of the price then there’s no issue in that case. But if the school couldn’t afford that and would possibly fail because of it, their options would be either to lower their prices and/or shutdown.
