Historically, things such as floods are measured in terms of time scales. A once a century flood line exists on most property maps insurance companies maintain. My suspicion is this is what the national weather center means here: a storm of a size that historically only occurs every x years. As these storms become more frequent, the averages will move. But I will defer to those more knowledge.
