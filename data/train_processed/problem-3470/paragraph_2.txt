Kevin McCarthy is the GOP minority leader and heâ€™ll probably be the speaker next session if the republicans win the house, which looks likely, but not by the landslide everyone was expecting, because MAGA is dumb and trump backed a slate of fucking morons (Herschel Walker, Oz, Mastriano, etc - qanon loons one and all).
