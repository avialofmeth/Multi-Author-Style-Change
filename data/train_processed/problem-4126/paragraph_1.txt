I mean, wouldn’t you get your lawyers on the phone if one of the counties (Cochise) refused to certify until irregularities were handled? I’d call my lawyers if I were in Lake’s shoes considering the AZ Board of Elections, which she does not control, has requested some very detailed answers from Maricopa County BEFORE they submit any certification. I’m not American; I have no horse in these races, but as a voter in a democracy, I would want these issues resolved and questions answered no matter which candidate is impacted. It was ostensibly a pretty close race and until the issues are sorted, it will technically remain up in the air.
