The law makes a lot of sense if you are more pragmatic than dogmatic no matter how conservative you are. If/when Obergefell is overturned how do you handle all the gay marriages in terms of legalness(beyond rights conferred by marriage, how do you deal with the division of assets when a marriage ends without divorce). This is much tidier.
