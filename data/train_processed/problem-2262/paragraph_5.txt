We're moving out of state in a few weeks. Our son came out to us as trans at the end of last year. He's still only thinking in terms of going by another name, using he/him, having a shorter haircut, and wearing more masculine clothing. He isn't considering hormone therapy or other treatments. Even though this particular bill doesn't immediately impact him, I can only imagine that things will continue to escalate, with the way that things are going. I shouldn't be surprised at where our state is heading, but it seems like a new bill is introduced daily restricting the rights of Tennessee's citizens.
