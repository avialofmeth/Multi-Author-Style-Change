EDIT : just to clarify I am happy for the ones that did show up but I question how dramatic an effect they had on the vote. Related to that there are many articles citing their favorite piece of data as to why the Dems did so well in the midterms. Most of those come from exit polls ( now we trust polls because we like the result !) . I view that data as too sparse and questionable to Garner good results from.
