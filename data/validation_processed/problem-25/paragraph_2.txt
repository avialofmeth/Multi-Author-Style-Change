Unfortunately, in most places I know about, it is a long and expensive journey for the victim to get free of this, despite the best efforts of the court system to deal with it. In Ontario, there is a rule that allows for reasonably summary dismissal of actions on the basis that they are “on their face” frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process; also, one could being a motion to declare a certain person a “vexatious litigant” - meaning they would require leave of the court to file further proceedings. Both orders would seem appropriate here, assuming Singapore has similar laws. Unfortunately, while this is as easy as the courts can make it, there are still procedures that must be gone through, excruciating for the victim as that is.
