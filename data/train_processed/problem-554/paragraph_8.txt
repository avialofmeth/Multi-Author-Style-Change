Isn’t it a jail-able offense to disagree with putin or their military as a citizen? I’d hate it. They do something stupid and you call it stupid, go to jail. So it seems like a shocking amount of their lives is saying as little as possible, to avoid saying something that sounds contrary to the party-line and boom… jail. Zelensky said it well that their citizens need to defeat the kremlin “in their minds”. They’re mentally enslaved.
