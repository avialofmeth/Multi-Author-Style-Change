Relatives and some friends in Vinnytsia, colleagues and their families/surroundings in Lviv/Uzhgorod/Mukacheve (which is most western possible), some friends in Kyiv and my whole life in Kharkiv - that's where my experience coming from. St Nicholas day is indeed used for presents (more on west, but east too) but never heard of Christmas presents in Ukraine at all.
