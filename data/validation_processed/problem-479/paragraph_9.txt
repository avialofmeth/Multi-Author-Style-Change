The commission is made up of Michigan citizens and has to have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and then it also needs a certain number of independents. And I believe that maps can only be approved with a certain amount of support by all three groups. Someone with more knowledge about the specifics of the commission could probably better answer your question than me.
