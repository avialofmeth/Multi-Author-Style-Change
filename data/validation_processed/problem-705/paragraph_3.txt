So yeah, sometimes, we sane people need to look around at each other and fucking empathize with each other about the nightmare that is living in a cult planet. If you don't like that, tough shit. We at least deserve to relate to one another while living through this horrible chapter of history. I can only hope humanity somehow moves past the dark ages where such ridiculous nonsense causes such heinous trouble.
