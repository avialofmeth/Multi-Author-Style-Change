Yes: this is not an acceptable article, and I've reported it. With the exception of the title, which is outright false, it may be a good example of what the US government describes as 'malinformation': it uses a collection of facts that are technically true, in a context that combines them to convince the reader of something that is not true. It's either an intentional attempt to mislead, or written by someone with such a poor understanding of parliamentary systems that they are not an appropriate journalist to report on European politics.
