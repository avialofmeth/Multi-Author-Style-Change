"For I cannot in any case tolerate cowardice. Let no one say when I am gone that I taught the people to be cowards... I would far rather that you died bravely dealing a blow and receiving a blow than died in abject terror...fleeing from battle is cowardice and unworthy of a warrior... cowardice is worse than violence because cowards can never be non-violent.".
