My point is that you can't really dismiss a politician as ineligible for office because they hold a fictitious belief. That disqualifies people in general. To make a distinction between a religious or non religious belief as being inherently more or less harmful isn't really appropriate, as it doesn't necessarily tell you what you need to know about a person.
