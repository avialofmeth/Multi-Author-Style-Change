Yeah, I definitely get what you're saying but I also think people tend to be a little more gullible when there aren't any stakes. It's super easy to sit at home on the computer and shit on China for things their government is doing but I guarantee a whole lot of people would get real interested in international affairs as soon as there's the possibility that it could affect them or somebody they know. I definitely acknowledge that there are plenty of dumb people here, obviously; my original comment said "the smarter half of the population", hahaha. I would just like to believe with all the info we have access to that a big enough proportion of the population would be against it that it's extremely unlikely.
