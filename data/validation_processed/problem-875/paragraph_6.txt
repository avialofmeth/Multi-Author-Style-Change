Okay, what neutral basic algorithm? What makes it neutral? Who decides if it is, in fact, neutral? Does it use existing political boundaries? Neighborhoods and ethnic enclaves? Or only natural ones (e.g. watersheds)? I can just imagine the politicians wrangling over which algorithm is more “neutral” than which other algorithm.
