Most of the best locations have already been dammed. The UK, a decidedly wet place, doesn't get enough rainfall to replace their hydrocarbon use with hydro. We are going to need nuclear if we wish to put a proper dent in CO2 emissions. It drives me nuts that the environmental movement is unwilling to support a proven scalable solution. However, don't take random guy on the internets word for it. I suggest the former UK scientific advisor to climate change, and Cambridge fellow David Mackay.
