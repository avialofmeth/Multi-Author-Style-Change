They pretend they are going execute them. For an example if the say they will electrocute them, then they will pull them out of their cell, take them to an execution room, hook them up to the wires and press the button. The prisoner thinks they will die. The button is fake and nothing happens. Not sure in these case what they are using to go through with the fake execution (I.e. electric, hanging, shooting, etc.).
