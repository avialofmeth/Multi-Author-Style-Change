I agree completely Weed does not hurt anyone. Alcohol is addictive and you can die from overdose, cirrhosis, cancer, drunk drivers /drunk driving. The biggest problem is there are those, ( a lot of), that have been subjected to the Government propaganda the Air Force put out in the 1950’s that Marijuana will make you go Mad. Lol It’s that, uneducated,Non experienced people that have never smoked weed in their lifetime that are against something they don’t understand or have experienced. And there’s the Religious community! They’re against every Fucking thing. 🤷🏼‍♂️. There’s always going to be opposers, whether they are right or wrong.
