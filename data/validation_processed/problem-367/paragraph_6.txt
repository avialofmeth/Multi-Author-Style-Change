Ignition was achieved a few years ago, this was ignition with an energy output greater than the laser energy, a first ever. Laser confinement is not considered a viable energy source however, it is not turning into electricity, rather they measured the heat energy released (or some other similar method). The point is that reliable, repeatable fusion reactions can give a lot of insight into how to get successful conditions for this and other fusion reactions.
