It's absolutely not. A (modern, western) requires separate branches of power, among them, an unelected judiciary, representing the core long-term values and laws of the State, so that a single government cannot undo everything that defined the state for decades. For true democracy, you need to do it the democratic way--prove that it's the will of the people through decades of reform and shift of laws, not a legislative coup against the rule of law.
