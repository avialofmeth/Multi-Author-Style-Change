Indeed says the average truck driver salary is 70k a year.. that's good money, maybe not per hour (they do work long hours) but that's above average and they can live anywhere so 70k on rural America is pretty good money... I'm not saying it's a great job.. I'm saying it's a job Americans don't want at any salary.
