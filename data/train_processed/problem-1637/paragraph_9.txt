Even the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer people a year than Texas does today. It was very much an oppressive organization under the control of the King of Spain, but exactly how oppressive has been overblown in the popular imagination. When it comes to witches the official stance of the Catholic Church is that witchcraft is people being deluded by Satan rather than there being any actual power involved. The witch trials that occurred were quite likely to result in acquittal if one of the various inquisitions were involved, purely civil courts were much more likely to return a guilty verdict but then you weren't really trying to prove that they were a witch so much as you were trying to prove that they were an asshole that everyone hated.
