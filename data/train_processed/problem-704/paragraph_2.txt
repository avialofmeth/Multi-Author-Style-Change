Progress like this is why I roll my eyes whenever warhawk pundits try to say that China is about to invade Taiwan any day now, but for realsies this time, we swear. They don't want to fuck up the progress they've made digging themselves out of the deep COVID hole and, with their severe population crisis, they probably don't want to do something stupid like send their young people to fight in what would amount to WWIII.
