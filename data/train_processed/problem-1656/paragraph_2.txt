Nah. There’s a particular type of quasi-Q Trump voter that believe in the stable genius narrative and have attributed a messiah like quality to him. They are either Trump or nothing at this point and there’s a lot of them. I work with some and am even friends with one and he’s hilarious to talk politics with. They have literally no understanding of politics, economics, or global implications outside of “Trump good. Election Stolen.” With that perspective he can say stuff like “no president ever has collected tariffs from the China.” When in reality almost every president has. We’ve been getting billions of dollars a year from China in Tarriffs and other payments since the 80s and have been collecting money from China since the 1800s. But they will believe him and bend over for him.
