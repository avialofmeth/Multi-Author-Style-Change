But to your point: depends how you measure evidence. (These are rough numbers because it’s been a few years) There’s about 10-20 times as many surviving records of Jesus’s teachings than Socrates. There are about 5 times as many publishing disciples of jesus than of Socrates. The most important/favorite teachings of Jesus were found/recorded in the historical record much sooner after the death of jesus than in Socrates case (in fact, most historical records of jesus were never lost).
