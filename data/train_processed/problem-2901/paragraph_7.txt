Country flag not always change with country policy. My flag represents my nation, not my government. And my nation did not commit any atrocities. To tell Putin he is a jerk you donâ€™t need to burn Russian flag, you need to tell Putin he is a jerk. Using neutral flag or national flag should be up to athletes to decide. In my opinion ofc.
