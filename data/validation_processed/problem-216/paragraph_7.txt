Without Truml on his side, and I mean fully on board and campaigning for him, I don't think DeSantis pulls as many people as Trump. He's not even that popular in Florida tbh. He BARELY and I mean barely won in 2018 with a decent democrat candidate. (Won easily in 2022 because, well, it was goddamn Crist...) With all his fascist moves, I wouldn't be surprised if he's polling lower with key demographics across the state. I'm getting tired of hearing about him as if Floridians love him like they do Trump. They simply DONT.
