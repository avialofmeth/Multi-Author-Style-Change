That is true but I donâ€™t think that all of the aid that we are discussing sending them should be made public till the last minute if at all because it gives Russia the chance to prepare. Also, he said we were sending planes months ago but we never did and the tanks that have been promised have arrived. Since Russia knows what is coming they know they need to do as much as possible as fast as possible.
