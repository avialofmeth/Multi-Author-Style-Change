Well I think the point to remember here is that what I just described is actually not that dissimilar to a number of incidents which have occurred over time at traditional financial institutions as well. And in fact, still occur from time to time. The point is that we, 1) put regulations in place to try and prevent this activity, and 2) have agencies in place to prosecute people who are able to hide illicit activity but later get caught, thereby discouraging others from trying to get away with that activity.
