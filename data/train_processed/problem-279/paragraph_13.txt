You are comparing apples and oranges. The 56 GW of installed capacity of coal power comes in addition to the over 200 GW installed capacity they already have, while the 500 GW is included the more than 150 GW they already have. It's also worth mentioning that this is installed capacity, measured in watts, not generated energy, measured in watt-hours. Renewable power plants generally have a much lower capacity factor, which is the ratio of the produced energy to the theoretical maximum energy the plant could produce over time if it was able to run at maximum all the time, than conventional power plants.
