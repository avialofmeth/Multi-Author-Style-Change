In my opinion only: Teachers are tired of being blamed for everything that is wrong. We have been called groomers, pedophiles, and told that we have a secret box of pubic hair. This all happened at CCSD school board meetings. When parents are called by the school, they blame teachers, they donâ€™t ask their children what happened. EVERYTHING is our responsibility and fault now.
