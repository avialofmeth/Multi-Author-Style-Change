When the economy is booming and unemployment is low there is high demand in the economy for goods. This bids up prices. This is why the Fed will usually raise interest rates to slow the economy to prevent inflation. When the economy is doing poorly, there is low demand and prices are bid down, this can cause deflation. The Fed then lowers interest rates to increase demand.
