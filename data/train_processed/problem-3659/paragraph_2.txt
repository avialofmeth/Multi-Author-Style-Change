I had vaguely heard of them before, but I didnâ€™t really appreciate they were a completely different religion - not Jewish, Christian or Muslim, but a whole separate religion that grew out of Islam in the Middle Ages. Apparently, it incorporates elements of a whole bunch of other religions and philosophical systems, but the beliefs are generally kept secret; allegedly the group does not accept converts.
