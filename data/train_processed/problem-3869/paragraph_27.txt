Oh, I would go with a form of MMPR. Partially closed ranked ballot, where we vote for our local representative separately from party share of the House. I'd also like to see the PM not be the leader of any party, but be another member, who is not a local representative, that is elected by the local representatives by a 2/3 majority after the election, to lead the House. More like a consensus candidate of everyone, and let the party leaders be the political leaders.
