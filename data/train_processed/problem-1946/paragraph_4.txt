I was worried about Salvini going into these past elections and with their sharing of power previously, but I'm happy to hear they're not as strong as they once were. That being said, their influence on Berlusconi back in the day and their change of leadership to what they are today (though rhetoric is still similar) I would say has certainly had an influence on the political rhetoric and paradigm. Like how Trump may have 'normalized' some of the more rotten characteristics of Americans to where we're seeing more of that particular brand of politics spreading on the local, state and national stage here.
