The article does not, technically, lie in saying that a bill to legalize cannabis has been introduced, and it even mentions that it was introduced by People Before Profit. It doesn't mention, however, that People Before Profit is small, Trotskyist, anti-EU party, with four TDs, making them the seventh largest party, and only the fourth largest leftist party. They're not just not the government, they're not even a significant part of the opposition, especially since they don't get along with almost any other leftist party other than Solidarity. PBP also supports leaving the EU, ending sanctions against Russia, and cutting Ireland's cow population by 50%, but to say that Ireland is "aiming" to do any of these things would be akin, for a US reader, to saying that the US aims to end the public school system because the Libertarian Party wants to.
