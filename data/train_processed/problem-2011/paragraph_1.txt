Usually yes, but Senators are considered elder statesmen for a reason. The members elected to the House are generally more inexperienced in the nuances of political procedure and precedent and aren't elected via a statewide vote. Therefore they are more prone to being a little more sensational than their counterparts in the Senate. Think Jewish space lasers or pedophile cannibals. That shit certainly doesn't ever come up in the Senate, only the House.
