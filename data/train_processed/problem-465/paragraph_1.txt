To elaborate; when the Bolsheviks took power they wanted to achieve peace with the Germans, but wanted to draw out negotiations for as long as possible because they believed the central powers were on the brink of collapse (which wasn't the worst assessment, but was months premature). When the negotiations reached an impasse, they tried simply announcing that the war was over.
