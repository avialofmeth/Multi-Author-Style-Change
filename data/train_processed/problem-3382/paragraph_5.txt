The USA has $1.1 trillion in debt to China. Down from 1.2 in 2019. Most of our debt, in the form of government treasury bonds is in Social Security investment, about 7.5 trillion. Since the USA always pays more then their set interest rates, and hasnâ€™t done negative interest rates unlike other strong reserve countries (ie Germany), high value investment in the US are actual considered a good idea.
