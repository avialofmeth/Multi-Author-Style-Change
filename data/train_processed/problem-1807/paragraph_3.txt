I’m going to refer you to your own comment where you said “why in tf don’t we go topple the regime ourselves”. Please don’t move the goalposts. We tried helping Iraq rule over itself too, and how did that work out for us. We have zero political sway over the current Iranian government and any military assistance we provide would feed into the implication that the west is behind the protests. Unfortunately, this fight is one Iranians need to fight alone.
