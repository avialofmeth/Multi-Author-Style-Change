Correct. They could still just say "FU" to France regarding the Caesar (don't need Denmark's approval if it was given to them, as only France is the export authority for the Caesar) and export it without France's approval, but that's going to make no western nation ever want to sell/give arms to them again, given they've demonstrated they won't adhere to contracts signed.
