But, allowing a foreign country to buy up massive advertising during a presidential election campaign seems like it should be illegal. I would think that the social media companies would have to complete some kind of legal document. If you bring a suspicious amount of cash into a bank, the teller has to fill out a CTR(currency transaction report). Why shouldnâ€™t the tech companies be held to the same standard?
