Yes, fair points, I am aware of this rivalry, I just didn’t bring it up here because my comment was long enough as it is, haha! Personally I am still leaning to the prisoner thing being a specific reaction to Soledar (as with mobilization the Russian Army isn’t that desperate for manpower anymore), but it might of course still be an expression of the larger powerstruggle between the Siloviki and the Prigozhin/Kadyrovtsi cliques.
