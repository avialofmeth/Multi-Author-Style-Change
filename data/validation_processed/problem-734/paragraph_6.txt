Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee. If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved. Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule. If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.
