I definitely agree with you, at least in Tokyo and the big cities. A bit more doubtful out where I live... they gotta be around at all to be doing that! The only thing I see them doing where I live is making sure people come to a complete and utter stop at the train crossing that gets 1 whole train an hour. Very dangerous place there, you know.
