I’m not trying to be one sided here, but if you look at the actions of each side in this conflict it’s pretty clear which one is the aggressor and which one is the defender. Even with your perspective, thinking that Russias actions are on some kind of moral equivalency is beyond ridiculous. There is no justification for the way they have conducted themselves in this conflict.
