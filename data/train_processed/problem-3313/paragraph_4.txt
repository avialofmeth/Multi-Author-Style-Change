If China could manage to incentivize Taiwan economically further (combined with Hong Kong, they receive \40% of Taiwan's exports currently which is about the same as UK's exports to EU) slowly vassalizing it without using military force could be a peaceful end goal that doesn't involve risking China's stability and global economy. Of course Taiwanese citizens aren't that easy, thankfully.
