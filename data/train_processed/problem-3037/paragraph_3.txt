It doesn’t matter who you are, where you’re from, if you’re richer then your voters, or even if you’re an actual, verifiable criminal. If you oppose democrats—if you’re willing to say insane nonsense about democrats, and call them the enemies of the United States—you have HOP voters’ full and unwavering support. That’s all they care about. They have no goals, no plans, no nothing. They just want someone to vilify democrats.
