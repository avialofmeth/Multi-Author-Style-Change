A lot of people think of him as an acceptable evil in a room full of giant turds. He's ineffectual without being incompetent. Rides the fence as much as possible which just ends up pissing off both sides (the liberal party in canada is centre left btw). Most people think it was better him than a conservative government but would prefer it if he actually did something instead of vague promises.
