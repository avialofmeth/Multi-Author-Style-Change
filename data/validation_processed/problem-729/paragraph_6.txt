Oh, I know. I own a lake house there. Great watersports, nice and quiet, but the local hangouts are the Wal-Mart parking lot, and members only (ie. white members) bars. Of course, that's dramatic. There are a couple people of color in the surrounding area, but not many. Some nearby towns are like being in deliverance.
