Articles like this are not written for those with an interest in military hardware. They're written for the general public who's of military vehicles goes to "if it has armor and a cannon, it's a tank" and that's it. They don't for, for instance, know the difference between an IFV and anAPC, or an IFV and a MBT. All they know is "armored + cannon = tank", MAYBE "armor + tracks + cannon = tank". So they'll throw around "tank" very loosely. In this instance they using "light tank", a term that hasn't even been used for decades, to describe to the general public a vehicle like a tank, but lighter. Because, again, the general public has a very, VERY basic knowledge of military hardware.
