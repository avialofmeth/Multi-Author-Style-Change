On election denial: “oh, Stacy Abrams did it, too.” Yes, she complained of election rigging and refused to concede. But how many people are there running for election right now with an explicit platform of supporting Abrams’ claims? Zero. By comparison, how many repubs are there running right now who willingly admit the election was free of major, result-changing issues? Not conceding, complaining of election rigging unless they win, vowing to change election laws in the favor, etc. are all part of their platform.
