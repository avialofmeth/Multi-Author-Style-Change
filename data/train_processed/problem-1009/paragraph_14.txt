But there are religious charities, and there are people who live a more moral life because of their faith. Do I think they need their faith to live a moral life? Absolutely not. Do I think there’s an inherent link between morality and religion? No. The morality is inherent to humanity, as is the propensity to exploit power structures like is done through religion. It’s all human shit, religion is just one of the masks we wear when we express our human nature, both good and bad.
