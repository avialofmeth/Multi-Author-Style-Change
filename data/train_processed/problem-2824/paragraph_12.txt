In the West our governments have a really bad habit of taking half measures. We spent like 2 decades fighting the Taliban, an enemy we could have slaughtered, because after the initial invasion we only had a few thousand troops stationed there, enough to continue fighting but not enough for a decisive victory. We are trying to provide weapons to Ukraine but we are only providing what they need to keep fighting but now what they need to actually defeat them… and these sanctions… the could do more. Severe ties completely, make all western companies pull out of Russia, ban the purchase of oil from any country the imports Russian oil and then resells it .. just to name a few.
