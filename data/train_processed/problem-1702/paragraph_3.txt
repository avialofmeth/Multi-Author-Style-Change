I don’t find the argument that we should do nothing because very specific scenarios exist where we might not want parents to see what their kids are doing online. The reason is because when a kid gets hurt by awful things online, the first thing everyone says is “parents should have known”. This constant arguing two polar opposite points has been going on for sometime.
