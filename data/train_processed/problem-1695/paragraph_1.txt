Sounds relatable. The wappies I know personally are strong cases of and proudly portray themselves as "free thinking/not brainwashed by the system" with their whole "I do my own research" narrative. At first I considered them people who call themselves "woke", until I learned those people focus primarily on micro-aggressions, privileges and more politically left subjects instead of conspiracies. Very confusing sometimes.
