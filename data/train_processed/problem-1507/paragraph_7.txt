This happens constantly, especially on the GOP side. The left has their Manchins, but the right is like a pipeline of former democrats who couldn't break into the party. They found out if you wave your hands a lot and yell about jesus and borders people will rush you into a seat. Many of them had aspirations of celebrity before their stint in politics (like MTG and Boebert for instance).
