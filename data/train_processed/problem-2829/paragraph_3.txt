Yeah, it's definitely worth noting that it was the tax cuts these dipshits so eagerly passed in 2017 that ballooned the deficit that they're now so concerned about. Of course, this is literally always what Republicans fucking do. The "Two Santas" theory in play, as usual: run up the deficit when the Republicans are in power (by giving gigantic handouts to the wealthy and starting pointless fucking wars), then blame the Democrats for not doing enough to combat the deficit and try to sell the idea that we're "broke" and "forced" to gut Social Security and Medicare... only to then turn around and run by blaming the Democrats for gutting Social Security and Medicare.
