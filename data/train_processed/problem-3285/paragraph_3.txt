This. According to Kotkinâ€™s second volume on Stalin, Stalin tried very hard to make pacts with the Britain but Churchill was vehemently anti-communist. Fearing Japanese expansion in the East, Stalin felt it best to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany so that he could focus on the East (we now know the Japanese at the time did not have intentions of invading the USSR). It seems he knew a war would breakout in mainland Europe and the hope was that Germany, Britain, and France would destroy themselves in the conflict; which, would enable to socialist uprising in these countries.
