Great question and smart of you to ask. There is no opportunity back in Russia, so Iâ€™m hoping someone is putting together a plan for them. Traditionally I would say this has happened dozens of times through history. By now we should easily have enough historical data on human nature to come up with something a little more proactive than just waiting to see.
