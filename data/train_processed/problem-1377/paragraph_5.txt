Today is always the time to talk about it. You make a good point I didn’t consider. My other thought was, “mental health agenda”. What does that mean in terms in terms of money? La GQP has cut mental health from budgets going back to Reagan who killed Federal funding of mental health in the 80s (that threw my sister out into the streets of Detroit). An agenda w/o $ is not a serious agenda.
