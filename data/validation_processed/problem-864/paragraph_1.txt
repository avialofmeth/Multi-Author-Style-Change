Ehh honestly this won’t be a popular opinion but largely with roads and schools I think the biggest issue isn’t funding, it’s refusal to fire bad employees. Throughout my schooling we had some absolutely amazing teachers, and some teachers that couldn’t teach a damn thing. We had teachers that were clearly checking out underage students, flirting, and grooming and nothing was ever done about it, and I only heard of one teacher getting fired. What did she do? Come in on drugs for years, talk about her abuse at the hands of her bf with middle schoolers (get the help you need but for the love of god don’t tell children), and what actually got her fired was they found out her teaching degree was fake, and she didn’t know Spanish very well after teaching Spanish for years.
