Other than social issues reducing the size and scope of military is probably the only thing libertarians and democrats agree on, but most libertarian sub groups view a strong military as the only thing they like federal money being spent on because of national security. However most libertarians also want to vastly reduce or eliminate foreign aid, most of which is given out in part to prevent the need for military intervention or support in other places.
