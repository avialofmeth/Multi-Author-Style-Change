So two donors (maybe a few more) sent 20K to her? Thought there was a limit us peon's (not wealthy) can donate to a campaign. Say on average these could have been $1,000 donations (20 of them). That would mean 20 idiots sent large amounts of untraceable cash (or cashier checks) through the mail... instead of paypal, vimeo or cred card payments??? What a bunch of morons....
