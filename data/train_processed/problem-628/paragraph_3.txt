People talk up Gaza as an Israeli “open air prison” ignoring that Egypt controls a border and Hamas controls Gaza. Hamas gets a lot of money and power by doing it too, and influence, all of which they stand to lose if they’re replaced in a democratic process. It’s in their interest to keep the cycle of violence turning, if it ever stopped they’d be irrelevant.
