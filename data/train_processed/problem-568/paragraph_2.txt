So it's free to PR around the world since it can't do anything to affect the war since it can't actually get there. What is interesting is that they are going on and on about these hypersonic missiles that can penetrate the best air defenses in the world. You'd think they'd use them against Ukraine since they are having trouble penetrating their air defenses. Weird that.
