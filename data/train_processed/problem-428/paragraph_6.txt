Several times they've attacked Iran's nuclear program. Stuxnet was the big one but they have bombed several places, sent saboteurs to break in and steal documents, plant charges. They've assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists. Recently they used a remote control machine gun to ambush some nuclear official. Iran does nothing but continue to fund Hezbollah.
