I’m actually thinking, were it not politically detrimental, these drones could be deployed to central americ to deter cesna filled with Colombian cargo in clandestine runways. You could circle them in 100 mile radius in loiter mode and redirect once a target is acquired. You could also program a fail safe mechanism which makes detonation impossible below 8,000 ft. I don’t think the Colombian pilots would want to play “battleship” with these loitering drones! These drones could pull double duty serving as eye in the sky and reconnaissance for police and highway patrol.
