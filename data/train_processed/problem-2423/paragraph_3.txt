That said, I think some of the healthcare suppliers, like Stryker, still doing business in Russia should be treated differently. After all, should Russian citizens be denied access to life saving healthcare supplies because of an invasion that they probably have no control over or power to stop? It is one thing to cut them off from McDonalds and another thing to cut them off from emergency/trauma surgery equipment, which Stryker provides. That said, other healthcare suppliers like Align Technologies, which makes orthodontic supplies could definitely leave without loss of life.
