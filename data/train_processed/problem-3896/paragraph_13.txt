I can see that argument, but at least in the House, they're not that focused. If it was McConnell, I'd agree with you; out of the current GoP crop he seems to be the most mechanical (and even he's pretty vengeful; see blocking Supreme Court nominee). But McCarthy and the rest of the House Rs are a lot less disciplined than Senate Rs and tend to be pretty cantankerous (see: Speaker fight), so it's more likely to my mind that they're just reacting.
