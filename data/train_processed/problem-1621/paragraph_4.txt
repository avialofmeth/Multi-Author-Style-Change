If one side of an issue is advocating for eating kittens as a solution to world hunger and another side is against eating kittens as a solution to world hunger, it's not wrong for a responsible news source to have bias in that argument. If anything, there are many issues (and have been throughout history) where it's woefully irresponsible for those with such a powerful voice to remain unbiased.
