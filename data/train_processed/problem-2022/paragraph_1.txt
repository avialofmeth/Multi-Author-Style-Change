What?? Haha the man who said he graduated summa cum laude when he never graduated, that he worked with the FBI when he didn't, that he worked with the cops when he didn't, that he graduated with honors in high school when he didn't, that he was CEO of a company with hundreds more employees when it had just like 2 dozen, he sold garbage like "proven COVID treatments" that were snake oil, defrauded the VA, and either committed tax fraud or election fraud (pick one depending whether he truly lived in GA or TX; he chose tax fraud because it was the lesser punishment.
