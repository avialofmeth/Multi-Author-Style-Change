As an “exchange”, FTX is allowed to offer relatively risky instruments to investors vs. what a bank could offer, but unlike a bank, is not allowed to then leverage investor funds to make loans, etc, and generate income. So unlike a bank, they’re SUPPOSED to maintain a 1:1 ratio of assets on hand to assets invested, to prevent exactly this sort of “run” from occurring. Whereas Wells Fargo for example can loan out people’s money and therefore have less than 100% of the value of assets invested actually on hand at any given time - this is because the FDIC insures those assets to reduce the impact on individual investors if there is a run on the bank.
