I agree. Billions and billions in advertising are spent to make us peasants and slaves think the billionaires are 'good people' for owning so many slaves. I don't get it, but I never really been well ingratiated into society and don't understand why people put up with having entire nations dominated by a few people only because they are evil enough to soak up all available resources and power no matter the cost.
