It's very easy for people who didn't use Twitter to promote their business or was part of multiple communities that were very active on Twitter to say "They must love right wing tweets randomly showing up in their timeline even if they donâ€™t follow them!". Either you're exaggerating or somehow I've gotten lucky because my Twitter feed hasn't had right-wing nonsense bleed into it it for about two years now.
