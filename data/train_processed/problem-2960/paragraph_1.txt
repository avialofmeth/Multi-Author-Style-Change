What about Jordan and black september? If Israel acted like Jordan integrating the population providing equal rights and citizenship remove military law and release all political and military prisoners then the conflict would have been over, the fact that most Jordanians and most palestinians refused to take part in the fighting should tell you something, my grandfather refused direct orders from the king and almost got to court for it, but again it was in the past like more than 50 years ago.
