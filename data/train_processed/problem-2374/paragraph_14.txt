Companies raise their prices every year because of inflation but have let the wages stagnate because "Some people in the team work here for 10 years and they still only make the money they got back then so I can't hire new people for more" and then act like them not finding employees is because nowadays people are lazy or demand unreasonable things like not having to work 10-20 hours unpaid overtime a month or expecting more money than the absolute minimum needed to live.
