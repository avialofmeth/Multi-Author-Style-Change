Perry only generally wins in my estimation due to the same mistakes that always seems to be the issue with stereotypical old school Democratic party. They spend almost no money in general on this race dispite it being a winnable district. They put up bad candidates or candidates with no name recognition, spend no money on TV/internet/advertisement. I actually know quite a few of the folks living in the district who always try to convince the state and national party of this for it to fall on deaf ears. Basically, from my understanding the the old school Dems running the party in the area ignore them.
