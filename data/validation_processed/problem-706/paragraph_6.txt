The idea that this is the GOP's idea of a qualified Black man makes me sick. If I was a Black Republican I'd be pissed, but then again Black republicans ready live in an alternate universe so they may actually be proud of this moron.During 2020 election they were so proud that they elected one Lt. Give. They had be reminded that Dems had already elected several Black governor's and we just elected a Blasian VP.
