Having a 1 or 2 seat majority either way is not a working majority for either party. It would break the majority every time there's a vacancy, which would lead to constantly re-running leadership elections, followed by replacing all the committee chairs, followed by replacing the committees majority staffs (the majority typically gets about 2x the staff on committees). Not to mention office space, which is also allocated differently for the majority party. The House would essentially drop into chaos every time someone resigns or dies. And we already have 1 Dem talking about quitting to run for mayor.
