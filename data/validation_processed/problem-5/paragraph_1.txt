I guarantee they went though all available options before choosing this course of action. Iâ€™ve seen airlines light mountains of money on fire to complete a flight in irregular operations like this. The two biggest factors in this were probably the inability to get a legal crew to the aircraft in a timely manner to fly it back to NZ, and the long distance from any other airports with Air New Zealand service with scant resources available for recovery.
