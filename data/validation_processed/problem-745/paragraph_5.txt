They are upset about things but they accuse innocent people while ignoring those who are actually doing the thing. None of them gave a shit about or knew about Balenciaga until Tucker Carlson did a fear mongering show about them, now they’re doing Qanon shit to circle things in pictures to back up their conspiracy theories. It’s pathetic and destructive.
