Healthcare in America needs a major overhaul. First and most important, healthcare needs to be 100% separated from employment. It's crazy that an uninsured (or underinsured) person has to struggle with the decision to seek medical care because of the cost. I knew a guy in college many years ago who had a freak accident knee injury and didn't get it seen to. That's a young man whose entire life (and subsequent employment) was affected by a lack of healthcare.
