Meh. I don’t think so. It sets a precedent and Republicans have bent over backwards to do literally the opposite whenever possible. If a “friendly” Republican was more palatable, there would be no Margarine Taylor Greene or Lauren Boebert. Neither are particularly friendly to McCarthy and cause him more trouble than he’d like. Hell, the same could be said for any of the “Freedom” caucus that have been implicated in the January 6th investigations.
