I hate the phrase “no taxation without representation”. It doesn’t mean anything to American politics. It was a feature of British law, not some sort of moral thing that the founding fathers aspired to achieve. It was also broadly not intended to be about individual voter rights, but more about territorial representation. The colonies just didn’t have reps in Parliament at all. They would have been fine even if only 10 percent of colonists were allowed to vote.
