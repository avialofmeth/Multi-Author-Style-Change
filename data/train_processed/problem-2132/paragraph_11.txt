Some insurance plans will cover implants for cis women who had mastectomies due to cancer but deny them for trans women because they are "cosmetic". If insurance companies think that breast size is purely cosmetic yet it can be augmented for the mental health of a cis woman it 100% can be done and paid for for the mental health of a trans woman.
