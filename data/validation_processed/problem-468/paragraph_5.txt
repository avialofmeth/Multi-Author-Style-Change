What? You mean the timeline of: Russia annexes Crimea in 2014, Trump runs in 2015 and wins, starts fucking with Ukraine's gov. by threatening to withhold aid and getting impeached over it, the whole trump tower moscow thing, and praising Putin, Xi, and Un, threatening to pull out of NATO, and generally being a twat trying to stay in power illegally until finally getting the boot in 2021, prompting the Russians to have to rethink their angle of attack raises your suspicions?
