1.LAWYERS WHO PLAY THE GAME-Lawyers have a lot of ways to postpone cases of given the opportunity. Depending on the persons history (convictions), evidence, and charge, cases for a lot of white collar crime can be put off for years until defense council has exhausted every avenue of getting affidavits, discovery, and so on and so forth. It’s pretty normal for a judge to grant a 6-month continuance for almost anything. Starting with the investigations (wire taps, warrants, and motions) to make sure everything is in order or if the judge requires a higher level of proof to protect the case on appeal. Once charges are actually brought it’s the same thing every step until trial (I assume the US Gov will go to trail and not plea).
