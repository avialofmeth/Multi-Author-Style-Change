It also hurts pushes to arm Ukraine with better weapon systems because many voters think they've already won the war. They need more weapons, more ammo, more winter gear, and a fucking air force. Why we don't have an American trained squadron of Ukrainian F-15 and F-16 about to deploy is insanity. We have the planes and training facilities, fucking use them!
