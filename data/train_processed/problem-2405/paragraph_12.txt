I mean I've heard a lot about USA trying to persuade Ukraine into democracy but that's only possible if the people want it. The USA wasn't even able to forcefully push Iraq or Afghanistan into a US friendly democracy because at the end of the day they just didn't want it and we finally gave up. Ukraine wanted it but of course as an autocratic regime having democracy influence nearby is a huge threat to their power. Putin is scared to lose absolute power and fears if Russia starts to see Ukraine succeed Russia may push toward democracy and take away his power.
