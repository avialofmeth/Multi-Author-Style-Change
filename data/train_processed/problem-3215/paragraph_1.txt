So homes forever increasing is both sort of a ponzi (rent went from 22% of renters income to 30% the last 2 decades, not sustainable forever without serious misery), and unless you include inter generational estate wealth tricking down is a net loss to everyone except current owners. It's the worst wealth, stuck, under your feet, only helps if your parents were owners too and maybe grandparents so it can trickle down with each death during your life.
