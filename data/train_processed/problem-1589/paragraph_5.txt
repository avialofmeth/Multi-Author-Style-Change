That argument is bullshit because we could 100% whip up a very special terrorism designation package for them, my country is literally built on loopholes. Itâ€™s loopholes all the way down. We could absolutely designate russia as state sponsors terrorism without screwing over the already screwed, a few pen strokes and a vote. We do it with omnibus bills regularly for all manner of dumb shenanigans. Unfortunately, that would take a level of cooperativeness, industry, and ethics the majority of them simply do not possess; plus it would detract from the time allocated for dumb shenanigans.
