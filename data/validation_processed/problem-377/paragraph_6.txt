3) considering weapons, it was proven not all the weapons sent to Ukraine get there. Part of it (up to 70% by some reports, but even if it is 25%) are lost in the eastern Europe, and some of them were already tracked in Poland, Germany and Finland. So in case of total war Europe can flip into a land of men not willing to be drafted, facing economical difficulties due to energy crisis (buying gas for triple the previous price does not overcome the problem of energy prices) and armed. That's not a place I would like to be, so I suppose the all-out war is not to be looked forward to.
