Good to know that it didnâ€™t somehow almost lead to the end of the world then. Edit: why remove all that good stuff you wrote about defensive/offensive purpose of nukes? Edit edit: how am I supposed to respond accurately if you keep completely changing what you wrote, btw placing nukes in south Korea worked wonders, because the peninsula is TOTALLY denuclearized and tensions have never been lower today lol/s.
