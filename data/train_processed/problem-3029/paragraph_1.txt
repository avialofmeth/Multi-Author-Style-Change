Fine, we can stick to the topic. However, Jan 6th is still related and relevant. Considering the fact that both parties are fighting for a majority of the seats and how they'll handle the situation further. I respect your opinion and I'd rather have someone who can keep their nose out of women's health. Seeing how Roe v Wade turned out and how quickly my rights were stripped is disgusting. Trusting some tv star with no experience and who doesn't want to codify abortion is far from what PA needs. I would hope that John Fetterman has a good team surrounding him.
