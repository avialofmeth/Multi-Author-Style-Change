Yes, served for 22 years as an military police officer. I'm telling you that because in ADDITION TO the normal panel of vaccines that Soldiers get, we got additional boosters because we were more likely to come into contact with blood borne illnesses. Every single year I got no less than three jabs for flu, hepatitis, and whatever else needed boosted.
