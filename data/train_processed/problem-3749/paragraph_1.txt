Burra, in partnership with Gavin Wax, got his start in politics with a takeover of the New York Young Republican Club, turning it into a proto-fascist network with links to a roll call of US and foreign far-right groups. The aims of Burra's inner circle were well stated by Wax at an NYYRC event when he said "We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.".
