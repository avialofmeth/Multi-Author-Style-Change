The anti fouling paint on the hulls exterior must have failed. The fungus would be below the ships waterline and not a threat to the passengers. The environment the ship gathered the fungus in was probably not compatible with their final destination and this is a precautionary measure to protect the environment. Viking, like most companies, has great ships and will probably need an extra layer of red paint to keep this from occurring again. This is common of all types of vessels that operate in different ecosystems!
