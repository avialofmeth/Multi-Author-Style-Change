I think it’s a trend that all stems back from Sarah Palin. She was sort of the fairy godmother of unqualified politicians that didn’t know enough about the job they were elected to have a conversation, so they just answer every question with a sound byte or a weird pivot to get back to a hot topic that they can deliver another sound byte. She showed Trump, MGT and all of them you didn’t have to be particularly intelligent, or know anything about the job you’re running for, to win a public office.
