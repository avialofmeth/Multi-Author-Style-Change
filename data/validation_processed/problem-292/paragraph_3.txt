Edit: this took my brain to some strange spaces, and it turns out that while young Prince George could be speaker of the US House of Representatives, he is not eligible to be the speaker of the House of Commons; as the speaker must be elected from the members, and he is ineligible to be a member of the House of Commons due to his age <18 and peerage.
