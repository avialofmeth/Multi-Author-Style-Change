True, it's officially peace time. But only for as long as Russia or China still see America as strong enough to deter them. Western Europe has been too complacent and Russia doesn't see Western European powers as more than a speed bump in terms of protecting NATO's eastern flank. If America were to take the same approach in failing to modernize and increase its military capability there would be both an invasion of Taiwan and an invasion of the Baltics in the next few years with more invasions to follow after that.
