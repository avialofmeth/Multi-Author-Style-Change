Agreed they need better monitoring and more frequent shutoff/diversion control along lines. I live near an ocean transfer point and shore tanks sit behind tertiary coffer dams and secondary containment pools. The same pipeline that feeds these tanks sits at the bottom of a small mountain. A few years ago, a city engineer flagged a run of this pipe for a sub working on a city highway project, the as-built drawings were incorrect and a neighbourhood was showered with Bunker C until the excavator operator got his bucket uncurled to direct the flow downward…. Into yards, a couple of streams- it was a mess. Two houses were destroyed due to basements full of oil. They could not stop the gravity-driven flow because it wasn’t driven by a pump or gas pressure that could be shut down and trying to stop a mass of crude flowing downhill by “putting your finger on top of the straw” would have risked causing vacuum-induced pipeline collapse miles uphill and more leaks in worse locations. We need triple layer, human-proof safeguards, company-posted cash bonds and company-funded response teams.
