Correction - they did have an air support. However the Su-25 missions rarely include guided ordnance (heck, even in Syria they did over 1200 sorties and only around 30 were with guided missiles) which resulted in less effectiveness. Russians did have a full control of the sky over the front lines (they used CAP doctrine with LR missiles that allowed their fighters to stay away from the hot zone, still maintaining control over it.) Why they didn't fully utilize it ? No idea.
