As a consolation, if she does end up winning, the GOP has a tough choice. Her seat has shown itself to be an incredibly vulnerable one. The party is going to have to make the choice on whether or not to shore up her next campaign by diverting a ton of funds from other candidates, or to cut their losses and be able to support candidates that just need a bit of a push and just call it a loss. If Trump winds up bullying the GOP for support, she'll probably get the money for her next election to secure her rabid vapid support, draining the coffers that could have been spread around more and costing seats elsewhere. If the GOP wants to keep Trump at bay, they can just withhold their money and it's one less Trump fanatic moving forward when she invariably looses.
