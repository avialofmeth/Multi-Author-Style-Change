I personally needed to speak to 13 separate individuals (which took a MONTH of auto-dialing) just to even finally be told that this "fraid hold" existed on my accpunt. And yes, that mrans the 12 people I spoke to earlier could see exactly what was holding up the application, but purposefully did not tell me instead instructing me to just wait (forever).
