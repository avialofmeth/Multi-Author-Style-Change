You’re correct in saying that CSIS has been screaming about this for years. This is an intelligence issue, though, so what the government is doing is not broadcast on CBC. Just because we don’t get regular updates on TV doesn’t mean they are not working hard. I’m sure they are. It’s a bit unusual to publicize something like this, but that could be part of the mind game that is an intelligence operation.
