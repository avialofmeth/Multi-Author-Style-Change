I wonder, what is the country? What is most important thing in it? For me it's people, human lives. It's the only thing that can't be replaced. But our government seems to be adamant in refusing to make any kind of talks to save the most important - humans lives. Even when russians are starting to openly terrorize civillians. Instead, they want territories where no Ukrainians live anymore, just so they could profit from resourses on it.
