Have you gone to the local food shelves? A) food. B) they might be able to point you in the direction of other resources. There are many overlapping state, city, and federal programs that can help struggling families. Lots of them go under used because they aren't well publicized. There are org and programs to help with heating bills, repairs, food, etc. I know time is probably one of things you have the absolute least of but a trip to the shelves might be very helpful.
