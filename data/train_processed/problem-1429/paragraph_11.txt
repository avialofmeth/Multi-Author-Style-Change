Thats adjusted for inflation. I thought that was obvious. Asshole lol. It's truly insane what we are spending on Ukraine. And now they want long range misses and fighter jets which would require us pilots to teach then to fly them. And for what? Even if we put American troops on the ground and push the Russians out do you think putin is going to allow Ukraine to join nato and put American troops right at his western border? Of course not. It makes no sense to spend what we're spending on Ukraine.
