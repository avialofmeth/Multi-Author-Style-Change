They don’t give a shit about their country or they would have convicted Trump if not the first time but most importantly the last time after Jan 6. Pretty apparent they only care about their own self interest and that is all they care about. They cowered when it came to standing up to Trump’s base. For them all that means is they lose their job. They however have no problem asking the military to risk their lives.
