The point I was making was that it would be paradoxical for them to not support Ukrainian territorial integrity because of their situation with Taiwan. Was I not clear enough, should I edit my comment? You're not the first person who's tried to explain the situation with Crimea vs Taiwan to me, even though I was already referencing that in my comment.
