Why do you think India and China, who each have their own goals on the globe, remain neutral, maybe slightly pro-russian in a passive way, in this conflict despite the risk of the global devastation by a crazy neighbor? Because in talks with their leaders Putin shows level of sanity enough for them to remain neutral, which means no global devastation on the table.
