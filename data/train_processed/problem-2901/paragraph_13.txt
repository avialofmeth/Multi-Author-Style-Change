Well I am this Ivan. Now try to understand - I speak fluent english but my family - don't. My education and work experience isn't being recognized outside my country. I have two children to support and feed. Imagine me moving from owning a property, having a respectable job to somwhere where my children won't be even able to communicate with other people? Also despite not agreeing with the general direction of my government - I did not vote for Putin, I still respect the fact that people like Vlads happily voted him into his presidency and I see a good reason why (because Vlads have it much easier life to live). I absolutely believe that war could and should have been avoided, war is a terrible tragedy yet and nobody sane (even soldiers, and generals) would rather not fight. Yet no matter what my views are - I have to obey the laws, I have to pay taxes just as anyone in US who voted for the government that lost an election.
