One interview I saw indicated that the committee was only focused on bringing to light the details of what happened and identifying the ring leaders. They indicated there were far more crimes and criminals, but this was only a starting point for the DOJ. I.e. it is up to them to identify all the players and related crimes, the committee doesn't have the man power or resources to go after the smaller fish.
