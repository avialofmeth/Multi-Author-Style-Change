This farce of a war with a nuclear “superpower” and its much smaller neighbor needs to end asap. Mad Vlad and his Generals have no idea how to fix this quagmire meanwhile real people are dying. Putin trying to pull Belarus into the war while Belarus seems to be avoiding any direct intervention again. Their army will do nothing more than make this a two front war again which didn’t work well the first time. Belarus’s army is weak and under equipped as well and that puppet of a leader knows he’s walking a tightrope.
