My wheelhouse is software development for critical aircraft systems, which are supposed to be regulated by the FAA. And this crash reminds me of Boeingâ€™s 737 Max crashes. It takes multiple often cascading (and mostly preventable) failures all along the system to end up with catastrophic events like this. And all of these failures have one thing in common: CEOs and their top management teams squeezing every last dime out of their business, to pay themselves and their shareholders obscene profits.
