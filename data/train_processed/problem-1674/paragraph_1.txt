One of the conditions of the UK giving up Hong Kong was that China promised HK economy and politics would have autonomy for 50 years. They couldn’t even keep that promise for 25 years…. about the same amount of time since Russia promised to maintain independent Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. Moral of the story: don’t trust autocracies since promises often don’t live longer than the leaders who made them.
