Kinda. But Poland has been moving hard away from Germany for awhile now. Designed their own rifle (only ar18 derivative that can operate conventional and bullpup formats, it's interesting to say the least) and buying vast quantities of artillery such as HIMARS from the US (400 or so), so I really think Poland does not really care about getting on Germany naughty list like the rest of Europe. Whether that's a good idea or not is another debate, but their actions speak "we don't care about stepping on toes, we find other suppliers".
