Not that the National Rally is any better regarding Russia though: Le Pen and the party have been indirectly funded by Russia since at least April 2014 through a Russian-owned Cypriot bank and then a loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank the same year. Also before the latest Presidential election a former conservative MP Thierry Mariani joined the National Rally and led the 2022 media campaign for Le Pen, and that guy is a notorious Putin and Assad stooge, who's visited Bachar El Assad, Russian-annexed Crimea where he met Putin, and . Le Pen herself said in April that she supported the help to Ukraine but she, Bardella and other high-ranking party members keep opposing financial sanctions on the grounds that it supposedly hurts the French people and economy without affecting Russia.
