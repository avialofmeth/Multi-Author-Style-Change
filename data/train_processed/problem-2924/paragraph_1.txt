I wonder how much money she saved from her many years as a star news anchor out there in Phoenix. Perhaps the whole reason behind her suddenly getting into politics was as a ready cash source if she and her hubby blew her anchorperson earnings on bad investments and the like. She can fundraise and I expect that she'll be coming out with a book soon as another potential cash cow. Maybe she's hoping for a generous offer from Fox News where they'll give her a national show and turn her into the female Tucker Carlson.
