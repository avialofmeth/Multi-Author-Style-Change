This is the reason the US refuses to give Ukraine ATACMS (very long range precision missiles that can be launched through the HIMARS platforms and hit inside Russia proper), due to the fear of escalating to nuclear weapons retaliation by Russia, in fact it was just revealed this week that the US somehow (not detailed yet) blocked the HIMARS platforms they sent from even being able to launch these missiles (as if they could have gotten them from elsewhere XD) so even if they did send them, unless it was a software update/flip of switch, they wouldn't be able to use them.
