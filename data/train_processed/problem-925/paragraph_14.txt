Size matters. France is a very centralized country due to its history… and also because it is smaller than Texas! American federalism was born with the country and the French people who may have heard about the seminal books written by Alexis de Tocqueville in the XIX century get that. What puzzles them is that federalism seems nowadays to fuel the divisions inside the United States. The new limitations on abortion since the Dobbs decision, with conservative states going in one direction and progressive states the opposite is seen in France as a breach in the principle of equity. There is a French passion for equity, equality, Égalité, much less for the two other words of our national motto, freedom, Liberté, and brotherhood, Fraternité. It’s all the same for taxation, gun laws, or the way you can express your vote on Election Day.
