Tbh tho the more I read about the nutty putty guy the more I dont feel bad for him. Dont get me wrong its a terrible, terrible way to go for him. But he had a pregnant fiance at home, hadnt gone caving in years, goes to a more difficult cave a couple weeks before his wedding, doesnt properly know the layout of the cave enough and yet he pushed through a unknown spot, and we all know the rest of the story.
