I get what people mean when they say Reagan would be seen as a lib today. They mean republicans are getting more extreme. But the point misses that Reagan’s beliefs were moving as well with the time. Like Trump he would just move to the right along with the base. And then the reason that’s worth arguing is because the modern far right exhilaration is due to a lot that happened under Reagan so trying to return to that is self defeating. We shouldn’t be doing “make America great again” but for republicans.
