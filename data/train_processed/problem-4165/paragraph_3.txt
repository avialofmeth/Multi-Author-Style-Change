Antitrust investigations have gone out of fashion for a couple of decades as judges tended to rule for the corporations. There are a few reasons for this, including a conservative think tank giving free economics courses to judges (which had some good consequences like economic literacy for judges but one of the worst ones was that many judges coming out of these courses believed that the bar for anitrust was incredibly high). The pendulum is swinging back the other way now. Antitrust suits have had more traction in the last few years.
