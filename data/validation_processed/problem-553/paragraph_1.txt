When I was in high school, we had a young republican's club, and they were all well groomed kids from upper-middle to upper class families who were all conservative leaning. They weren't bad kids or anything(this was in the 90's), and at the time, there wasn't this hyper-racist sentiment running through the republican ranks like we see today. Of the ones that I have heard about since then, the ones that went to college mostly turned liberal sometime in the early 2000's. I don't know of any from that club that didn't go to college.
