I wish more about the actual effects we see on the planet were highlighted more when discussions about climate change and human activity come up. We see talk about global temp changes and ice melt, but I wish there was more focus on what was happening in the oceans and why it’s some super scary shit that needs to be addressed RIGHT NOW. Phytoplankton is responsible for half of the oxygen we breathe and it’s the base of the food chain for ALL life in the ocean. Some scary changes are already occurring with phytoplankton and we need to reverse course immediately. The situation in the oceans is beyond five-alarm fire levels.
