The only reasonable and humane solution here would be to force Russia to halt its war via full Nato intervention. Russia knows they got no chance against Nato, but as long as Nato pussyfoots around, Russia gets to destroy all the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine, leaving, eventually, 40 million people without electricity, heat or water as winter approaches. I do not find this a palatable eventuality.
