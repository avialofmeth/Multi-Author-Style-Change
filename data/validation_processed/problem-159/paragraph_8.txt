I can see some holding that position, even if I disagree. The Mueller report was evicerated by a partisan DOJ, that effectively denigrated it in front of a right wing congress, that wouldn't convict a ham sandwich. Two impeachment proceedings that were actively ignored by sitting republicans. The jan6 committee forward its results to a new DOJ that has appointed a special prosecutor. At the outset that committe was by its own rules, to investigate irregulatities and make it less susceptical to quasi machinations like the fake electors scheme. Time will tell, democracy is messy, but still the best form of government that we have.
