Unlike trumpets in US, PiS voter base is not entirely demented. They keep voting on them mostly for two reasons - a) they keep giving out money to people via various social programs and keep promising new batches of it every voting season, and b) they are very pro-Catholic and keep targeting them as voters. Despite that less and less people are going to church, there is still a lot of Catholics in Poland and the Church keeps promoting PiS as a party that should be voted on (cause PiS keeps giving the Church money and land). Can't say I agree with them, but y'all need to understand that conservatives in Poland are not the same as in US.
