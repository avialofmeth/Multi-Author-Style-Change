One path is that he gets to 210ish, the holdouts get a few more concessions and feel they've made their point, and give him the votes while threatening to keep him on a short leash. Another is that they go a few votes without him getting to 218 (and potentially losing votes), and his supporters see that he can't get there and start negotiating on a new candidate (Steve Scalise maybe). Or holdouts/Dems could give him the win in an alternative manner, by having a handful of members voting present to lower the majority threshold or voting on a rule to change the threshold to a plurality of members - although whoever is caving here would want significant concessions.
