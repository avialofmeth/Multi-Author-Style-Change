Yeah somehow with all that's going on I didn't even put those two events into context. Are we gonna start taxing and distributing UBI or what? They are literally investing in the tools to replace half the work force at the moment with AI. All while burning good portions of the workforce in tech. The bottom line where we are heading is honestly disgusting and quite frankly unsustainable for the majority of the population.
