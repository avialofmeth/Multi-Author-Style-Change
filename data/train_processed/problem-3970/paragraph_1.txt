Democrats would not threaten to shutdown the government, if the speaker is vacated, we will have to go through this process before we even get to the point of getting legislation through to refund the government. It is a terrible idea for everyone and gives very few fringe candidates with no actual policy objectives the ability to shutdown the government. When Democrats try to raise the debt ceiling, some Republicans will go along so these guys will vacate and screw the country. It is not good for anyone except people who actually want to destroy this country and can not be used by the Democrats in any meaningful way. That does not mean they should help Kevin as they shouldn't, doesn't mean what he is negotiating is reasonable at all, because it is not.
