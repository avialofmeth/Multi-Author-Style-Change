extremely na√Øve of you to think that a common "distaste for US global dominance" is a trivial unifying factor amongst the BRICS nations. perhaps you didn't even read the article i linked above, nor the quote i pulled from that article that says "If accepted, the new proposed BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves." that is far from trivial and I hardly believe these nations would announce their application into BRICS publicly if they thought it was doomed to fail.
