More broadly, I wonder if WFH is such a victory for employees as they think it is right now. Feels like it leads to an averaging down of salaries where Americans need to compete directly with labour in other countries, and an increase in expectations in terms of midnight meetings and "hit your targets or be fired regardless of the circumstances because just being present isn't measured anymore".
