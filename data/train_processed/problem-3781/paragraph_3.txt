Regular Ivan has to maintain his family, he barely has any savings and has to pay for his apartment's loan for the next 20-30 years or so. He cannot run because his wife and child/children depend on his income and cannot hide because hiding involves him losing his job. He cannot decide to take a part in this war on Russian side or not, he is obligated to in order to keep his family wealth. I know it sounds dumb since other people's lives and your own one > your wealth, but when it comes to family they have no choice unfortunately. That is exactly how Putin controls people using their poverty.
