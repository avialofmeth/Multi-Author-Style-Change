The Republican constituency has almost no expectations from the people that represent them other than be republicans and oppose the democrats. These awful people rise to the top of the party because being terrible to people that are different happens to satisfy their constituencyâ€™s expectations. DeSantis is terrorizing school children and trafficking humans around the country while Trump is trying to one up him by promising to execute more prisoners. The worse they are, the more popular they become with their base.
