It goes past the constitution. They apply this line of thinking to everything. They tout Abe Lincoln as being a republican (the parties use to be reversed, republicans back then were the democrats of today) to prove that they aren't racist, while at the same time praising the confederacy and fighting to protect confederate statues as their "heritage." They jump at the opportunity to point out that democrats formed the kkk (again, parties were reversed) meanwhile the entirety of the kkk lines up behind the gop with republicans working to keep their support. They have full blown meltdowns when any form of gun control is even remotely suggested, meanwhile reagan (their beloved pariah) jumped on gun control laws because the Black Panthers were arming themselves and black people with guns is scary to them.
