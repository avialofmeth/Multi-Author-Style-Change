Then again, I wouldn't underestimate any Republican from now on. I was sure that Trump had zero chance of actually being elected in 2016 and we all know how that turned out. Until the results are in after the 2024 election and say that the Democratic candidate won, I'm not going to count the Republican out. Even then, given the Republicans' penchant for challenging election results because "it's fraud if I don't like the outcome," I might not fully rest easy until inauguration day 2025.
