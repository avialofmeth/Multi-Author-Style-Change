There's a rule in the arena of life that you never interrupt your opponent when he's busy fucking up. If the guy wants to use up his entire government's treasury on expensive fireworks,... I just hope that at least he masturbates or something with each missile he fires off,... At least that way, he has a fond memory to attach to each time he threw away millions of dollars.
