Where are you getting this from? UK net migration has been fairly stable and this was obviously planned by the Tories by the fact they lowered the Skilled Worker visa minimum salary to £25.6k from £30k (this can go even lower if the workers are in certain sectors). They also reduced the cost of visas for health workers. This is probably one of the few things that the Tories have actually done successfully. Even a broken clock is right twice per day.
