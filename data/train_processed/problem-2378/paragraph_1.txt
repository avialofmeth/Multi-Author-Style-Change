Either way even if the US gets involved directly, that might make it no longer proxy by textbook definition, but it would still be the US effectively relying on TW to do the bulk of the fighting against the US's greatest adversary, or the US using another nation to attack it's enemies (and I don't want to make it sound overly manipulative, because obviously both Ukraine and Taiwan desperately want the aid of the west, and the west wants to aid them, but there is truth to the US wanting to use other nations to do the fighting if at all possible while instead supporting them financially...).
