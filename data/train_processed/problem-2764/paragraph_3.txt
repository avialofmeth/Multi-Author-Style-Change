It also feels like the dynamics in Georgia shift depending on if Democrats already have the majority (50 + VP vote as tiebreaker at least) or if Republicans voting there know that race determines control of the Senate. Walker seems like a candidate a decent number aren't excited about but will hold their nose and vote for if Senate control is at stake, just look at all the ballot splitters who voted for Kemp but not Walker. If Senate is already decided, a lot of Republicans might stay home. Though that also requires Democrats to still come out in large number and not just think it's a done deal.
