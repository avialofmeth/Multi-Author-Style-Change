Either way, the official numbers won't be revealed until after this sick war is over. I see every day that Russian numbers are posted but any reference to Ukraine's losses is almost always removed or corrected. I am not saying they are lying but in every war/era there is a media narrative as well. At the end, its the people fighting and families who are losing, these numbers are just numbers to most people not realizing each number has their own story and life to tell about.
