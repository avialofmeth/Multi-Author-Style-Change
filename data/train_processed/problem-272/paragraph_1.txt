I've been following the conflict as best as I can and am definitely concerned for Ukraine (obviously I guess). My biggest fear is the West in general losing steam on its support and Russia dragging it out. As a direct threat to the West though I think Russia has set itself back pretty significantly. While they were never meant to fight a war of this magnitude at partial mobilization, it's hard to argue that the Russian military has underperformed to a pretty big degree. Recommend any of the War on the Rocks podcasts with Michael Kofman, he's a terrific expert on Russia.
