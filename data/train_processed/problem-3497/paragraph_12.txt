I work in this area (legal side). The guys that come out of these companies are as good as their US special forces counterparts because they are going through their own identical, albeit private, pipeline. Their job is to be able to--should the need arise--engage in conflict with nation state special forces. The 1 buyer as of right now is the US military itself, because it can send PMCs into countries that it can't send US troops.
