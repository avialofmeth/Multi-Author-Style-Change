There are some deep negative ties to Ukraine as well. Ukraine has consistently voted against Israel at the UN. I’m not sure if that’s changing lately but that’s how it’s been for years. The fact is that Israel has it’s own serious security threats and their working relationship with Russia could greatly affect that.
