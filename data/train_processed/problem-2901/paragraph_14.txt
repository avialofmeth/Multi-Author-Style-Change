It's not seen as wrong to protest. There is even a pretty well written procedure on how to organize peaceful protest. You are safe from detainment or arrest if you simply follow it. And the best thing there is no legal framework that forbids peaceful protest, just puts a certain limitations on it (like you can't block god damn roads without prior negotiation, you need to prepare a formal notice etc.). I have seen many protests that went fine without anyone being detained.
