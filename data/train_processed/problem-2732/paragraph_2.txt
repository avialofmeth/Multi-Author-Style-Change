I don't think you know what degrowth is..? it's not going back to the monke, or even the pre-industrial revolution, it's simply cutting on the unnecessary. its about how you should be wearing two folds instead of burning fossil fuels in your house while you are at war with a country that sells you those fossil fuels.
