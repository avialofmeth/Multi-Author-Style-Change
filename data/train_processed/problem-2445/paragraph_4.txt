I wish it wasn’t shot down but I don’t have a problem with it as that is pretty much how it goes. It’s the story that in 2023 China is sending a balloon across the world to take pictures of missile silos and that Republicans blew it out of proportion. If the Republican politicians of the greatest super power in the world get butt hurt over a balloon that just looks bad. Meanwhile people are telling me I’m wrong and China is in big trouble. They won’t be able to make agreements from a good position because now they owe USA a favor.
