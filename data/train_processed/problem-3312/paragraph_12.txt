Honestly I believe that the future will be in desalination for our freshwater needs. And if we set up facilities up and down the coastlines on both sides and build many pipelines crisscrossing the nation we could heavily reduce our reliance on natural sources of water like lakes, rivers and rain fall. And maybe consider filling that giant aquifer under the plains before we see more of the land sinking.
