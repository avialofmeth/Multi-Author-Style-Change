These the same gas companies that earned $205 BILLION in profits for 2021 all while being government subsidized? Amazing that them making "a relatively small change" to their pricing, I assume for entirely nice reasons, is causing people to go homeless. Almost makes you think we should do something to, idk compete with that to make sure they're not driving people to that or is them making $200 BILLION just not enough for you? Are those execs just hurting too much and they had to make those price changes?
