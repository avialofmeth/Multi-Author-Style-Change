definitely how much free supply is available for purchase is a factor for house prices which pushes up rents since the two figures are corollated. However, supply is still the big culprit since even if investors owned all the supply, more supply would mean more competition in the rental market and investors would be forced to take a lower rent per unit. so at the end of the day the make up of the investor vs owner occupier is still less of a price pressure on rents than number of units.
