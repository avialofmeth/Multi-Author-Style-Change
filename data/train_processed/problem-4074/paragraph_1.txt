I remember watching that movie sometime after it came out. Man, that was a fun movie. My favourite part was that, at the end of the day, he learned absolutely nothing. Pretty sure it's implied he has the deuteraganist and main love interest (an American woman) assassinated at the end of the movie after learning she's Jewish.
