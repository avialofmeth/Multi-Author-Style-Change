When I called, they asked me if I wanted an ambulance, someone to talk to in person, or just talk on the phone. I asked for someone to come over, and two people from a local suicide prevention center (behind the Taco Bell around the corner - I had no idea) came and talked with me. They didn't pressure me or anything like that. They just wanted to assist me with whatever option I choose.
