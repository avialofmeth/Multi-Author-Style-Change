If you grow up in a small community of religious people, expressing doubt about that religion will likely make your life suck pretty fast, possibly even at home too. Surely this is not the case for most people living in larger cities, but I would assume that a large number of people live in smaller communities and are thus more exposed to all kinds of social pressure.
