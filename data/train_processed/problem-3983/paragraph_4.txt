I am not sure why but it seems like there are no Levi’s jeans that are not made of stretch material out there anymore. Whenever I’ve gone on the website for a specific type, 527 slim boot cuts, it’s always stretch fabric, which loosens so much, and I don’t think they make the good ones anymore, it’s irritating, and the times I have tried to get some on sites like Poshmark, the sellers never respond or are dead accounts that don’t mail them. I don’t know, just feel wound up all of a sudden, want the workday over, feel like packing up my bags for a trip I am taking in late March already. Edit, did listen to Chulahoma by the Black Keys on headphones, that helped.
