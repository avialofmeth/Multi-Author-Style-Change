I am truly glad to see a feminist support this. As a non custodial father, it is very frustrating knowing that i am more than willing and able to pull my weight and do the best i can for my child, i just don’t have mom’s permission. Almost begging to play a bigger role and handle more responsibilities, but the laws create an environment for mom’s to say “no” for no other reason than because it isn’t illegal.
