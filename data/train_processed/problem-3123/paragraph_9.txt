That’s part of the issue. USSC nominees were supposed to be bipartisan for their nomination by a majority vote, but the polarization has become so ridiculous over the past few decades that of course favors will be made behind closed doors. McConnell saying a judge can’t be nominated during an election year, then doing it is just one example. Also, the original comment I replied to was in regards to the Federalist Society. They fucking groom their picks. “I’ll get you a seat but you have to dissent whenever we want you to.” It’s all transactional and fucked up. Even Obama caved a bit with his nomination of Garland, a moderate conservative by today’s standards, and was shut down just because a president with a “D” nominated him.
