smell a rat. . I'm sure when it was discovered Trump took documents. Every ex president or worker scoured their premises for potentially unreturned documents. And to think his attorney couldn't return documents under the radar poppy cock. Someone had someone over a barrell. Trump has more clout (dirt on people) than we estimated. He knows people. Now everyone has documents in their closet toi minimize Trumps assault on America. Difference is that he'd sell his info.. A compromise, quid pro quo..
