Violent criminals with AK's murdering people for a pack of cigarettes, kadyrovites raping fsb officers figuratively and literally, mass defenestration of russian oligarchs who don't bow to one of the ten currently active warlords, military hardware being sold for a crate of vodka and then used to resolve a dispute between neighbors. And many, many "Sorry, I'm apolitical, but the war is for sure bad" russians violently dying every fucking day. That's going to be a fun few years.
