Yesterday there were some new numbers published: Since the start of invasion 65,000 Ukrainians got a regular job, 21,000 are additionally employed in "Minijob" i.e. jobs where employers earn less than 520 â‚¬. This number is expected to rise in Q2, when a lot of Ukrainians are through their integration and language courses. German market is expected to be very receptive for them. One problem seems to be the handling of childcare though.
