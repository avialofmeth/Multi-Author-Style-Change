Z boy, I’m suggesting that your comment that Russia is doing well at any phase of this war is silliness. Retreating in a panic isn’t consolidating anything. HIMARS is consolidating their ammo out of existence, and recently hundreds of their troops in a single attack. The only ‘strategy’ Russia has had was taking out their defeats on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and that capacity is dropping too.
