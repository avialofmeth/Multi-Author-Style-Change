I think what’s missing is that the Germans actually set up a repair camp in Slovakia for their gear in ukraine. For United States to give the Abrams they’d basically have to do the same, but inside ukraine near the front. This is why everyone hopes ukraine will get leopards. Which they should, with Bradley’s. Abrams would be nice, but not practical…it’s like giving them a bunch of aircraft carriers….by the time they figure out how to use them effectively, the wars over.
