Prigozhin isn't popular with the Kremlin and the Russian Military who view the guy more as a competition to their power and would never want to see the guy in charge. But the guy isn't stupid, cruel, but not stupid he knows how to "play the game". Any strife in Russia and this guy with the money and private army is going to end up being strongest faction due to depleted Russian military, there's going to be little Gerasimov or Shoigu can do, they do not have the charm or tongue of Prigozhin.
