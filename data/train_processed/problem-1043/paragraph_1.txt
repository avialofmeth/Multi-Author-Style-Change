Ok so I swear to god it was on his Wikipedia page for years, but after googling it to show you a source I can’t find one. Apparently he did date Laura Ingraham though, but I know almost nothing about her while I’m very familiar with Coulter, and I’m guessing that whoever had initially written that Wikipedia entry got the two confused. Sorry for the misinformation! He did date an insane blonde conservative, just not the one I thought.
