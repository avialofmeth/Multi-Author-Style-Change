Right, America's Hegemony in Putin's syphilitic framing. America and Europe are so prosperous because we operate fairly, foster strong economic ties, allow dissent, crack down on corruption, and have a million other things like a free press and independent judiciary authoritarian regimes can't stomach. Putin mistakes the west's soft power for hard power, and tries to tell himself with just enough tanks and enough rapists he can force his neighbors to love him and form a new "power pole" to counter the wests. Incidentally, Putin is a known aficionado of a passtime where he would get kicked in the head. Not sure why I mentioned, that.
