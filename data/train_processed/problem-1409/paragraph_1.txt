The post title is extremely misleading. The article’s actual title is “Soccer players union "sickened" as Iran's Amir Nasr-Azadani faces possible death sentence over protests”. From the article it seems like he hasn’t been sentenced to death yet. I’m not defending Iran at all. Just passing on info as someone who read the article. He’s not officially doomed to die. It’s still a possibility though.
