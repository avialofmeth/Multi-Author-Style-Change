I'm going to write a series of vampire novels were vampires walk around accusing everyone else of being a vampire. The vampires will scream for anti-vampire laws to be passed. They'll demand a wooden steak in every house. They'll sell steaks with funny sayings on it. The MyPillow Guy will become super anti-coffin.
