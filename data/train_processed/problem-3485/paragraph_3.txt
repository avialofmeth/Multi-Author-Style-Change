I can't speak definitively to this case but oil contracts are purchased months ahead of time. Oil contracts are also not always directly purchased. One can go into the market for a certain amount of oil futures delivery from another party. That party can source the oil delivery from Russia - it isn't always clear what the source is either at the time the contract is purchased or when the contract is delivered.
