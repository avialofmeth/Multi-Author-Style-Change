It’s easy to make that assumption but be making the classic mistake of underestimating the opponent, dramatically. He has blundered recently, yes, but look at how successful he has been in meddling in US politics. Not to mention his beginnings as a KGB agent, rising through the ranks, and how long he’s been able to stay in power. You don’t get to and stay in his position in a nation with such ruthless politics by sheer dumb luck and cruelty.
