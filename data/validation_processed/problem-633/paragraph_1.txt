Nowadays, to have any sort of meaningful wealth in Russia you need to be a creature of the state. Half your assets are considered state property. (If not Putin’s himself, although I’m not sure he sees much of a difference.) You act in its interests and it tells you what it expects of you, and dipping a toe into Russian politics is entirely off limits unless you’re directed to.
