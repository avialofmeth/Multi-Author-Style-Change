They're likely not far off... the injured to dead ratio out of Syria is horrific. I don't think I've seen another disaster other than aircraft crashes with worse numbers than what are coming out of Syria. I don't know enough about Syria itself to grasp the numbers, but it's looking extremely grim for them.
