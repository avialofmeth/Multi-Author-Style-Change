The guy that responded to you said that peace cannot happen while Israel exists in its current state. You said that’s true; Netanyahu needs to be replaced, which implies that Netanyahu is the problem with Israel’s current existence. So I’m pointing out that Palestinians attacked Israelis long before, after, and in between Netanyahu’s tenures.
