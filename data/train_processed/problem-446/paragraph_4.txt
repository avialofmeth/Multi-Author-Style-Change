I'm pretty sure the ones that are in storage are being refurbished and sent to the Polish army. As I understand it the Ohio Lima plant responsible for making the Abrams tanks ready to go "boom boom" was only partially operating between 2014-19 and they weren't manufacturing any new Abrams tanks in that time. I don't think any new tanks have been built since then either.
