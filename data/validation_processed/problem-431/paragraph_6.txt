These "the gubmint gonna track ya!" folks seem to be technologically stuck in the 1920s or something, because the government has about 100 ways to track all of us at any given time, most of which the average American has no awareness of. Hell, just look at the hundreds of people who were caught after Jan. 6th. Their phones were just hemorrhaging breadcrumbs that whole time and they never even thought to get rid of them.
