Even as proposed it doesn't abolish the court. That's a silly take. It just allows the Knesset to override it by simple majority rather than the more standard super majority. And the people voting are themselves subject to direct democracy. Everyone's pearls are fine. Israel needs a constitutional convention and actually hammer out a sensible set of checks and balances, but democracy isn't on the line because it needs 16.7% less than a super majority to overturn the court. "This is the death of democracy" is becoming the liberal equivalent of circa 2002 "this is how the terrorists win." Dial it back.
