So the railroad workers would be gambling that the railroad barons wouldn't be able to replace then then right? My understanding of the argument about why they can't be granted basic sick leave is that there is no one available to cover for them. Wouldn't that mean they have the leverage to just continue holding out for what they want, fired or not?
