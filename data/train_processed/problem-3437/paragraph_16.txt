Since noone is willing to do to Russia what was done to Germany or Japan to actually reform society, after Putin dies, Russian leadership, will likely scramble to fill the power vacuum like after Stalin or Mao did. Those already in the ingroup will play their alliances off one another and the result will be either a Khrushchev reorganization or a Clique that will be eventually out-competed due to internal squabbling like China. In none of these scenarios will Russia fundamentally change, because there is no pressure for it to. The populace does not care or act for its future.
