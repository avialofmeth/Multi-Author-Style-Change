Their model airplane community was extremely good at cleverly making excellent planes with far worse resources. I have seen examples of Russian made hand built radio control systems that worked pretty good. I was spoiled by really nice Japanese engines and RC gear, but I sure admired the homebrew Russian stuff I saw.
