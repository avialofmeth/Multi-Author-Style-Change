I've noticed that in recent months, second half of this year I guess, Amazon has gone from being pretty damn quick to get items, to a very slow and arduous process. I will place an order and maybe within a week and a half it will post as shipped. Then I've got to wait for it to arrive which even with prime is usually about a week.
