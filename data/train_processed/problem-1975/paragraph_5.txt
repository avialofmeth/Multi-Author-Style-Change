I'm in my early 40s. My father likes to tell stories about how he paid for my sibling's birth, his college degree, and graduate school while only working part-time. (My mother also worked part-time at a small, rural restaurant.) My father went on to obtain a second graduate degree while teaching part-time. He had no student debt and, therefore, does not believe in student loan forgiveness.
