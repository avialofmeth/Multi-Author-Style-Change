Also, I agree with this detainee that the US should do more. After decades of sanctions to tell us we need to revolt against our government and force regime change, time and time again when there are movements... our people haven't really gotten support from western governments. Now we're talking about 4 months of sustained civil unrest against the IRI... and there's still so many high level members of sepah/IRGC and the government that western countries are sanctioning.
