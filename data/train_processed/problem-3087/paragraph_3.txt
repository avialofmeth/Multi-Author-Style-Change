When I was 16, my guidance counselor recommended I take a Hillsdale College campus visit because I wanted to study political science. I'd never heard it, but the pictures looked pretty. Because 90s, the internet existed, but was not robust enough to alert me to what it actually was. I've never felt so uncomfortable. The first two people I met -- an administrator and a student tour guide -- led their talks with the fact that the school didn't take government money so they could screen for students based on ANY criteria they wanted. They bragged about how this allowed them to require prospective students include a picture with their applications "so we can see who we're inviting to join our community.".
