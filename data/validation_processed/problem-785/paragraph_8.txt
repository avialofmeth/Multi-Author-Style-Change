People putting up a sign saying that it's a gun free zone didn't stop this literal child from obtaining a gun. A law in VA that makes it illegal to hold a firearm in a way a child could take possession of it didn't stop this. Child endangerment laws didn't stop this child from getting their hands on a firearm.
