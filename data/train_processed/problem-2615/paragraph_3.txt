Not having RNA vaccines is not the reason why they are still follow Zero Covid. After you ease the restriction, there will be shit ton of people infected and the Medical infrastructure will be overload regardless. Vaccines mostly prevent Death, not infection. I live in Vietnam, after 80-90% of the population got vaccinated last year, the gov started to open up and the number of reported case skyrocketed. I personally know some people who got Covid 2-3 times despite having 2 pfizer shots.
