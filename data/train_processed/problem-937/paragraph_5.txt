The English Bill of Rights 1689 states that "That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law." I'm not saying that this hasn't been essentially decimated by more modern regulations, because it has. But the Common Law right to bear arms in England precedes even that law.
