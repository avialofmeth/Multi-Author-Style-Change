A month in, isn't that when all the fires started? People burning down buildings that were supposed to hold stocks and manufacturing capacity. I mean, the government paid for those things. And sure the value of the directors yacht is nearly the value of the entire contract. But who can tell if they ever really existed or not after the factory burned down? And you get to collect on the insurance after you bride the investigators into writing a report about a totally accidental fire.
