Because there are none - the thing EU talks about is interpretation of EU law Enel vs Costa - not law itself (which is issue because Poland is fully text is more important) - and this leads to issue with Polish constitution and validity of treaties in Polish context (don't get me wrong PiS did certainly make machinations with law - but that does not mean EU can do the same) - Polish constitution is explicit by article 8 - which establishes "supremacy" (more like superiority).
