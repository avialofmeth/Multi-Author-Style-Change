From experience some Druze do consider themselves Arab and some don't. Keep in mind if course that part of Druze culture is being a "patriot" of whatever country you live in. So while in Israel they have very high drafting rates, that doesn't stop the Lebanese Druze from drafting to the Lebanese army at a similarly high rate. In Israel many of the Druze who live in the Haifa region don't consider themselves Arab, but simply as Druze while in the Golan region they mostly do consider themselves Arab, but more specifically, Syrian.
