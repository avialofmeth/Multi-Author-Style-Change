I believe this. It’s just surfaced now. Our society is so divided. So unequal. I’m hanging out just wasting time, Bc of the huge blizzard outside and even watching “the crown” ( netflix) is getting hard bc I despise rich ppl so much. Why do the Brits even allow “ royalty” anymore when their own ppl are hungry. The rich think they are entitled to the vast majority of their wealth but most of it, no. It’s basically stolen. In the US,( where I am), poor ppl who support MAGA, the GOP and Trump just baffle me. I’m rambling … I’ll go. But yea, I agree, it’s a cesspool alright.
