I think discipline might be stretching it. He’s made a bunch of bullying actions and then when he received the slightest criticism he slapped back at _the_ primary employer for his state in a way that would make other businesses (his primary source of political clout) hesitant. He’s a Yale grad yeah, but I don’t know that I’ve seen him act any more mature than trump ever has. I don’t know that we need to “all his actions are planned because he’s a genius” the way we did for trump (and later learned was complete bullshit).
