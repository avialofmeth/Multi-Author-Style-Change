Thomas Newcomen would be proud we figured out so many uses for the combustion engine I'd imagine. He'd probably also be disgusted that we've built personal hunks of metal and paved over 60% of the landscape to move around in metal deathtraps in a rush to provide more economic activity. The device was originally created to pump water out of flooded mines. To make work easier for man. Not to kill us in a rush to get to work.
