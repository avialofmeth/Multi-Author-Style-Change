The earthquake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale with a 7.3ish aftershock (and numerous smaller ones). Both would be classified as major earthquakes which are expected to lead to the collapse of many buildings. I suspect the issue is what was done in terms of preparedness and emergency response capabilities.
