I feel like they can be let back in after they've done the first two and started on paying reparations. Showing a sincere effort towards repairing the damages should qualify them for the global pr events like the Olympics, and then the more important stuff (like starting to drop sanctions) can come after hitting various targets on the way to having fully repaid and prosecuted their war crimes.
