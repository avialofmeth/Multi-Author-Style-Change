We need to unionize all the low paying jobs that have become the "service industry" Mass boycotts of things made in China would help,but good luck getting people to do that or buy a higher price for a product. I think all of us have felt the supply chain issues that have come from having overseas production.But I doubt a change I'll ever come,we are all to brainwashed , in Canada you vote conservative or liberal and neither is really that different.
