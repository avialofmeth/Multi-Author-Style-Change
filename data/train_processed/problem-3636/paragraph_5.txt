First of all, thanks for the belittling explanation; I am an anthropomorphic baby not unlike the film Boss Baby so the concept of federalism was confusing to me until now. More importantly, o wise oracle of what AZ & WV residents really like and want: are you gonna tell me that clinking champagne flutes with the world’s wealthiest in a Swiss ski resort town is a “meat & potatoes issue” in those states? It’s funny how we shouldn’t speak for those folks, but they have no problem telling us what these constituents really want….
