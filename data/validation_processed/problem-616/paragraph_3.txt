IMHO, the collapse of the insects' population has little to nothing to do with climate change. The latter is caused by greenhouse gases, while the former seems to be caused by something, or many things, that is/are toxic to insects. Theoretically, we can get climate change under control, but still lose our insects. As lowering our emissions, recapturing and thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere significantly can halt climate change or even reverse it. But will very probably not save the insects.
