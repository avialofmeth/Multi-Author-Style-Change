Seeing Lukashenko's name often reminds me of a brilliant scene early on in Servant of the People. Zelensky is practicing meeting foreign heads of state using body doubles, and immediately stands up each time to greet them. When the Lukashenko double walks in, Zelensky's advisor stops him saying something along the lines of "no no, there's no need to get up for him". Zelensky casually replies "of course".
