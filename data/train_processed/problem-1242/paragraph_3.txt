Seriously, the legislature is holding a special session not to fix what they couldn't fix the last two times they tried (insane home insurance rate increases), but to figure out how they're going to strip Disney of municipal authority. Thank you so much, guys, that was definitely weighing pretty heavily on my mind. Paying triple to insure my house that's not on the coast or in a flood zone seems like a minor problem relative to whether Disney runs its own fire department.
