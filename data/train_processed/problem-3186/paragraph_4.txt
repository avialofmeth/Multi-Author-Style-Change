>This is the direct result of years of conservative-led efforts to successfully defund, defang, and delegitimize the IRS. Over the past eight years, Congress has steadily reduced the agency's enforcement budget by billions of dollars, down 25 percent from what it was in 2008. And by cutting out only relatively small chunks at a time, the gutting has largely avoided public outcry. Unsurprisingly, according to ProPublica, the IRS is in disarray on the inside, resulting in "a bureaucracy on life support.".
