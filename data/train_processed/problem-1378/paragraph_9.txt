Chief Justice Rehnquist who was a known quantity and had already been a justice for a couple years. Rehnquist, while very conservative, also ran the most efficient court ever and proved to be a stable presence who was a great administrator. He also gave us Dickerson which upheld Miranda. Scalia was a originality and while became known as the hard right and voted against due process rights, he also gave us quite a few good criminal rulings. Howe ver, he was also very questionable in his decisions and was a gift for the hard right. O'Connor became more and more liberal as time went on. She was conservative but was a much easier person to deal with and gave balancing tests instead of hard like stances like Scalia and Rehnquist. She was a swing vote with Kennedy(more on him later) and was a really good one. She upheld Abortion rights,affirmative action, and joined the liberals on some criminal cases.
