That’s the thing tho. I read their shitty comments on articles and I read the random r/conservative posts that other subs laughing at them post because I want to see wtf they’re talking about doing now. And so far on this I haven’t actually seen any wondering or surprise. Nobody even actually questions if that’s “fake news” or whatever. What I see them saying is shit about ways they can get the people against them not to be able to vote or just real ugly, hateful/violent shit directed at us. And that’s a lot scarier.
