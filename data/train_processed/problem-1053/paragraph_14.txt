There is a huge difference between the two right now. First, the Ukrainian troops are volunteers. Ukraine has mobilized several times but hasn't had to actually force anyone to fight yet because they are more than willing to volunteer to fight for their country. The same is not true if Russia. We've all seen the videos of soldiers grabbing people off the street to conscript them or choosing minorities over Russians in a way that makes them know that they're expendable. The level of morale difference is huge.
