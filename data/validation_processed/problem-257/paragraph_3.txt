Next cycle hopefully we can crush the anti-wokeness bullshit and force the Republicans back into a state of being a legitimate party with an actual policy based platform, something they haven't been for over 40 years now. I'm fine with an opposition party existing that I disagree with. I'm not fine with an opposition party that I find contemptuously reprehensible.
