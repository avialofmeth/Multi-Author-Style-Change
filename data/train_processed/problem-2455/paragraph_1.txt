In a lot of ways, he's pretty fucked. If he backs out of the war, he's as good as dead, if he escalates to nuclear weapons, he loses China and India and probably sees NATO intervene. And his forces seem to be losing or holding in conventional conflicts, but he has an extreme faction at home that won't tolerate that and wants escalation or someone who will escalate. He's basically spinning a bunch of plates and hoping nothing goes wrong.
