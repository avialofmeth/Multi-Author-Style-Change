How is it that you can lie THIS much and get elected? Do we not have rules in place for getting on ballots? Do you not have to present a resume like a job, considering this IS a job, one of the highest in the nation? It should have a ton of scrutiny. If you say you were employed at a place, it should be verified. Same with school. Military. Charity. Anything and everything. You posted to some r/furry thread - better believe we as voters should know it!
