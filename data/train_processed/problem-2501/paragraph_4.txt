What is uncommon here is that FTX only actually made something like 25% of FTT available for the public to buy, then transferred the other 75% to the crypto hedge fund. So the value of FTT was being pumped up due to an artificially small amount of it being available to buy. In reality, had the other 75% been available, the true value of FTT would have been much lower. A few days ago the crypto hedge fund’s balance sheet was leaked, which showed that about $8bn of their assets were actually in FTT, meaning that it wouldn’t actually work as collateral should they need to repay their various loans, because if they did in theory make it available to investors the excess supply would tank the value of FTT, and that 75% would be worth nothing like $8bn (not to mention it was never really something that should have been allowed as collateral anyway because it has no underlying intrinsic value, unlike USD, real estate, etc.).
