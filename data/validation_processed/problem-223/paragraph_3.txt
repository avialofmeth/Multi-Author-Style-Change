The greatest conservative minds recognized this as a political problem, so they huddled together and created political theater accusing the left of leaking the decision. They hoped that Americans would be more outraged at that than taking away women’s health care. The problem with their logic is that women’s health is a very real problem to millions of Americans whereas a leaky SCOTUS office is only important to DC politicians and political junkies.
