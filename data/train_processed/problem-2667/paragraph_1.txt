Not to defend the stupidity of not reading linked articles, but I've lost count of how many times I've opened a post to read more, and been bombarded by an almost unreadable article that's syphilitic with ads, pop ups, and requests for cookies. It's definitely trained me to be less likely to click on the article. In this case the article is perfectly readable, but it's not always the case.
