This is why he makes no effort to keep his lies straight: he's not lying with the normal psychology of a liar, which is someone who knows what the truth is and says the other thing. He's lying with the psychology of someone for whom reality is wibbly-wobbly at best. Even when he says back-to-back things that are completely contradictory, his brain doesn't parse it as a contradiction. He said the truth the first time, and he said the truth the second time, and if you sense any contradiction, that's just evidence that you're unable to keep up with his perfect brain and that shit's on you.
