Oh we did atleast a bit but not in history most if my school knowledge about other continents cultures and countries outside of Europe comes from my geography/econimy not history class. We learned a lot about North America espacily the usa as an example diffrent places like the rust belt the great plains we learned about the economic system and the red scare. We also learned about Japan and their culture stuff like their school system their economy and how strict they are over there. We also did a lot on Australia we did the least amount of stuff about Africa mainly geography like names of rivers and mountain ranges. But we mainly focused on the trade triade of Europe the US and Japan as they are the 3 biggest economic factors of the time approximately 2012. So we learned quite a bit about diffrent places but a lot of history more like how it is now.
