I think a lot of people have swallowed too much kool-aid and think Russia is itching to launch nukes. I do not think it a realistic possibility at all that Russia would commit suicide by going there. They have absolutely nothing to gain by doing so, and would lose absolutely everything if they did. And they know it. It's why they keep bringing it up; to scare the world into allowing their genocide of Ukraine to continue.
