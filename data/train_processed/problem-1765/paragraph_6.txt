They always do the same shit when they are in power. Cut taxes for the rich and powerful and boost spending on the military. All the other stuff is just rhetoric. They will also talk in circles about wedge issues. They will again talk about repealing Obamacare or cutting social security, but they would’ve actually do it if they could. Now that they overturned Roe, they will talk about banning medication abortions and birth control next. They might stop talking about that when they realize it won’t make them more popular with voters.
