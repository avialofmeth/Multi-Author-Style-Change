While it is true that Ukraine probably needs rescue workers more (not saying Turkey doesn't need rescue workers of course), Ukraine is only considering sending a fairly low number. It's more a token to demonstrate Ukrainian goodwill towards Turkey to improve/maintain relations than anything else I think.
