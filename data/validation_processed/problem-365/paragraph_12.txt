There is no real proof that Lockheed Martin is profiting of this war, or even encouraging it at all. And if it were true Russia could still end the war very quickly. I don't think the sanctions would come of now while Crimea is still in Russia's control, but the arms to Ukraine probably would if Russia just went back to the 2020 borders.
