i was shopping for a hula hoop for my kids on amazon, came across one, noticed the reviews were all about the marketing photo of a kid and then there was a discussion about how it's sexualizing, etc. the photo on amazon had been removed by the time i came about it, but i found it on the brand's website and it was just a kid in a normal gym outfit posing with the hula hoop.
