There was a video posted interviewing some soldiers and they said it messed them up how so many Russians just walked to their death. Some would attack without magazines in their rifles. Others just walked towards them in the open. Some seemed so oblivious to everything that they must have been on some powerful drugs. Each one of these, they had to kill and the bodies piled up. And each time it's the same thing over and over.
