But the opportunists don't actually believe. They don't actually care about what the believers care about, in either direction. They're happy to let innocents suffer at their hands or the hands of their followers, but they'd also be perfectly happy in a world where everything is pretty much okay for everyone, so long as they are in control either way. But of course, it's much harder to come in to power over a world like that than a world of fear and anger.
