This was the year that I finally realized that Fox News doesn’t necessarily lie about these things, they just don’t report on them at all anymore. I grew up in a house that watched that channel for news, but back then they still at least showed most things. Now they’ve figured out that their devoted “all other news is fake news” viewers won’t ever know if they just ignore major news if it’s problematic to them (literally most of Trump’s presidency) because it’s not like their viewers are going to find out/believe it if it didn’t come from Fox.
