I'm honestly terrified right now on reddit seeing how many people are just shrugging off nuclear war as though it won't even be a big deal or something. I wonder if people don't understand that even if half or three-quarters of Russian warheads fail, tens or even hundreds of millions of us will die - some quickly, others horribly. And that map is just American targets! Surely the capital, industrial centers, and airports/bases/etc of ever other NATO nation, and especially every other NATO nuclear power, is on that list in a full-scale nuclear scenario.
