Quite intriguing that the world sees Muslims as synonymous with Arabs when Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world and we're basically more akin to East Asia in terms of customs and culture than Arabs, most of the women don't even wear hijabs most of the time. (Some extremists like to change all of this ofc, but that's for another time).
