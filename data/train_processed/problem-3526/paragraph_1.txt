Yep. The smart move for them would be to purge the crazies out and get candidates who reside inside the current Overton window. Not all early Trump backers were clan members. A lot were disaffected by our system and they wanted a disruptor. Trump disrupted a lot of things, but mostly just norms and ethical standards. When it came to governance he ruled like a Republican, judges and tax cuts. The tax cuts benefitting most voters were temporary, and it seems a majority of Americans think the judges they've placed are out of touch with what Americans think or want. So what reason do these voters have to continue voting for Republicans?
