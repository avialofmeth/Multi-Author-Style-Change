This special counsel is exactly what I thought would happen. While there is part of me disappointed, “when the fuck is this guy going to actually get arrested?” The politically complicated nature of this Trump president brand is best placed within the confidences of a special counsel (who will have the power to indict). If this doesn’t lead to indictment, I will feel physical pain, he must be held accountable and no man is above the law, but for men that are so mired in political spotlight, special counsels are the right call, unfortunately, in my opinion. It’s ironic, to say the least, that this is a very political move to appear not political (and hopefully be non-political), but that’s what politics are.
