Donâ€™t worry, some absolutely pants-on-head-stupid American activist on twitter was crowing about how much better life for trans people is in Iran than the US. And could not be swayed from that position, even when it was pointed out that a lot of Iranian transitions are forced and come from a place of homophobia. So, there will be a bad faith take on every fair point made on this topic.
