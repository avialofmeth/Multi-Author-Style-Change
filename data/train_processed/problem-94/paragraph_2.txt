You realize this person wasn’t protesting the Ukraine war, right? Very short article. She saved a cow from slaughter and took it downtown to show it off. She was there on a tourist visa. She’s done so in several other countries as well. She seems to be a vegan/animal rights protester or something like that. I still personally wouldn’t be protesting in russia, but that’s the least of their concerns and I wouldn’t chalk her behavior up to “courage”….
