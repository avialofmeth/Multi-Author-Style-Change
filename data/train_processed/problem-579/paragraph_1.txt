LMAO you really don't know shit about these things. Even if Sino-U.S conflicts break out into a war over Taiwan, none of the NATO allies are obligated to get involved, because Taiwan is not a NATO member and no U.S territory is under attack. And no, U.S air bases and carrier fleets will not "all be used"; only the bases at Philippine and Korea will be activated, and only 1 or 2 fleet will be needed to prevent a complete lock-down of the Taiwan strait by China.
