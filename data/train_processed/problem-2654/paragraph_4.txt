The Post reported on the many questions about biographical claims from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.). She has told conflicting stories as to whether she is Jewish. She claimed to have been raised as a “Messianic Jew,” but relatives say her father was Catholic. (In fact, her grandfather fought for Nazi Germany.) She changed her last name from Mayerhofer to Luna, and The Post found no evidence for her claims that her father was incarcerated for long periods. Other claims that she was traumatized by a home invasion in 2010 did not check out, either.
