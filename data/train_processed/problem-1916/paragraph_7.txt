After I got horribly sick with Covid two semesters in a row because we were forced to be on campus despite being at peak covid infections in FL, I knew it was time to go. On top of that, allowing strangers to come on campus and harass students about hellfire and abortion was absolutely fucking insane. I couldn’t walk from one class to another without some grown man spraying spit at me while he screamed that we were all going to hell for wearing shorts and tank tops IN FLORIDA. Not to mention the joy of having to walk past billboard sized banners they allowed off-campus, unoffiliated groups to post in the student union of diced up fetuses and dead babies while some moron yelled that abortion was worse than the holocaust on a fucking bullhorn. But, hey, freedom of speech for the people who aren’t even students is way more important than an actual students comfort on a Florida campus, amirite?
