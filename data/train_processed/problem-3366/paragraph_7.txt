In the more rural communities, absolutely. East Palestine is not rural though. I'm from Youngstown originally, about 30 minutes to the north of there and even 20 years ago the township was pretty much interconnected to the Youngstown micropolitan and Akron-Canton metropolitan area. Ohio has tons of tiny sized and small population townships like that, butted against one another based on old late 1600s 5x5 ish mile farm plot designations. It makes it seem considerably less developed until you're driving through there and can't tell where one township ends and the next begins and you're passing through your 4th or 5th township in a half an hour.
