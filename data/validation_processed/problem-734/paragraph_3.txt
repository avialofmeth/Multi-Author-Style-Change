Yep, this is a scheme that is the origin of the current 9-justice composition of the court. There were 9 circuits so therefore 9 justices. Of course, the fact that there are now 11 circuits, plus the DC and Federal circuits kinda makes it seem like we need to have more justices. Weird how no one in the government seems to agree with that.
