I wish he hadn't gone back either, but to be honest I think his martyrdom would be the only way he could hope to spark a revolution. He went back knowing this would happen. I think it was his last ditch effort to break Russia free from Putin's grasp. He wouldn't have a hope of sparking anything from abroad, given how tight Putin's control is over the media & Internet.
