I used to work with classified document security. Believe it or not, breaches happen more frequently than you'd like to think. Usually, they don't amount to anything, and initial offenders usually just get reprimanded. Repeat offenders, or offenders that don't cooperate with security, will be charged and held accountable according to the level of classification of materials left unsecured. This includes revocation of security clearance, heavy fines, and prison sentences.
