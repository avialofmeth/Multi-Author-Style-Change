That was pity foul but 1969 is NOT the crux, the crux of betrayal and violation of international law began in 1962 when our governments were blackmailed to authorise the UN invasion/disarming of West New Guinea (General Assembly resolution 1752) ; it is ILLEGAL to then conceal resolution 1752 & the 'New York Aggreement' it was authorising from the Trusteeship Council whose job it is to prepare yearly UN reports about UN trust territories such as West Papua (West New Guinea).
