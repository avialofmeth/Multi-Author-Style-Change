Not yet. This ruling is incredibly soft and allows Deris party to retain his ministries, and for Deri to remain a member of knesset (even though he's signed a plea deal as a condition of one of his convictions promising that he won't return to public life). As well, the government is planning to pass laws which allow a simple majority in the knesset to overrule the supreme court, effectively nullifying it. So the battle is far from won.
