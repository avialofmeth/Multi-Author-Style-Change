In 1990 I believe he had a nervous breakdown and thought he was the son of "the godhead" that should only wear turquoise. He went on the UK's biggest talkshow at the time and told everyone his theories and the audience just ridiculed and laughed at him for being crazy (you would hope today that the producers would cut the interview short as his was clearly having mental health issues).
