In the U.S. people challenge why we (the U.S.) have bases overseas, treaties to protect other nations, and buy goods not domestically built. The American first attitude has eroded the trust nations like Japan can place in the U.S. with regards to keeping promises made so long ago. Japan investing in its own military is the next natural step. Next Japan will start settling their own global outlook and priorities. Then at some point down the road when Japan's priorities diverge enough from the U.S.'s priorities everyone will act surprised. Some future administration will be blamed for the deterioration of international partnerships.
