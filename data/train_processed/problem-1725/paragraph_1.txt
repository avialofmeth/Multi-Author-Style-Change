Please don't fall for the propaganda pushing the idea that Biden abandoned rail workers. Take time to understand how frustrating it is to collaborate anything with Republicans right now...they would have killed the bill entirely if paid leave was in there..then would have sat on their hands blaming Democrats for the fallout even though Republicans would have been directly responsible.
