If Manchin didn't exist, the idea of someone as liberal and broadly supportive of the Democrat platform as he is winning in WV would be an absolute fucking joke. Nobody in a thousand years would believe it to be possible. He's easily one of the most crucial and least replaceable people in all of US politics right now, and he even wanted to retire before his last election but stuck around because he knew his seat was incredibly important.
