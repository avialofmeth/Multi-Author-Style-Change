Definitely more battle hardened than the American, just less well equipped and networked. The last time the US fought a peer threat was WWII. Experience in counterinsurgency simply doesn't translate. Two armies in the world have now fought a land war in Europe in the lifetime of their leadership, and nobody else will ever match that experience, I hope.
