the US Gov knew exactly where it was at the time they shot it down with a missile. Granted, it had to fall for 60,000 feet, but I'm sure we have people in the military who know the rough math for that (about 2-10 minutes to fall 60k feet or so). Maybe not 'exactly' when/where, but within a few miles.
