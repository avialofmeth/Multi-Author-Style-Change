Keep in mind that part of this, not all of it, but at least part of it, is theater. Bad cop says let's nuke Moscow into the ground, good cop says hold on let's give Putin a chance, each role is more effective together than apart. We don't need to give Putin an actual out, we just need him to think he has one, if that makes sense.
