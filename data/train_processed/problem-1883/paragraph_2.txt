Yup. That’s one reason why most great conquerors maintained their empires only as long as they were alive. Genghis Kahn’s was falling apart by the second or third successor after his death. Alexander’s fell apart about fifteen minutes after he died. And honestly, even if they do plan for their death, once they die everyone who was obedient out of fear now has no reason to be afraid.
