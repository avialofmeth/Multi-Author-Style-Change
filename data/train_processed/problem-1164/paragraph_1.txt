FOOTBALL fans at the World Cup have reportedly been pictured jumping over security fences outside of the Al-Thumama stadium. Footage taken next to the stadium appears to show fans outside of the Canada vs Morocco game being refused entry into the ground by security personnel. The stadium closure comes despite many fans in the queue holding tickets to enter. In the video the police can be seen trying to intervene to resolve the situation but with large amounts of fans also not holding valid tickets it has caused big delays in getting spectators into the ground. And with crowd tension spilling over after the security barriers were lowered, some jumped over the barriers in a bid to get into the ground.
