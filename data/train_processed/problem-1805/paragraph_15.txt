Polands rhetoric is not somewhat critical but so outside what is even slightly considered normal, that you somehow managed to have the right and left wing of our politicians agreeing that PIS is dangerously unhinged. Quite the achievment. I genuinely am curious how you are going to excuse calling the democratically elected chancellor of Germany a fucking NaZi, especially considering he is from the SPD.
