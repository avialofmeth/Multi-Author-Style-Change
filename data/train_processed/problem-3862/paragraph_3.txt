They aren't exactly creative with the killings though. They keep throwing people out high windows, it's like they can't think of any other "accidental" ways. Whoever is carrying out the hits clearly hasn't gotten a single Silent Assassin rating in their miserable life. There's definitely a terror element to it, like sending a message that they're not afraid to kill anyone, but at this point it just looks sloppy to try to sell the same dumb lie every freaking time.
