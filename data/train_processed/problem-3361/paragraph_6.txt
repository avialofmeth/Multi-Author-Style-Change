In contrast here, for most of Trump's presidency I made an effort to give benefit of the doubt when I saw headlines saying he said something misleading, false, or otherwise just awful. I'd go in reading those articles looking for ways Trump was getting an uncharitable assessment. But, far more often than not, when I read or watched the things Trump actually said, the headlines were actually giving Trump more credit than he deserved. The crap that came out of Trump's mouth was regularly even worse than the headlines I tried to take with a grain of salt.
