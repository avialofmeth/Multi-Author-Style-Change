US has logistical reservations about M1 Abrams going, because Ukraine can't maintain them, given the gas turbine engine that no one in the Ukrainian Army have worked on. They can be trained on them, but it'll be months on end before they're ready to deploy them, and Ukraine needs tanks they can utilize in the next few days/weeks to start counter offenses.
