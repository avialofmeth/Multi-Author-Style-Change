that is a very good point. hopefully they solved any diplomatic issues beforehand. there were rumors of this for like the last week or so. they just signed a agreement for abrams, afaik like 1200 and i think they just got a shipment of k2 tanks for korea. so, things are lining up for them to give ukr tanks.
