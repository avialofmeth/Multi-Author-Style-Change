Just FYI the country is called “Ukraine” not “the Ukraine” in the official name of the country there is no “the” anywhere. While I’m sure this was not your intent “the Ukraine” refers to more of a geographic area and not a country and it’s frequently used by Russian sympathizers in order to imply that Ukraine is not a real sovereign country.
