Oh no the world will hate Qatar even more after the world cup. The world's rowdiest fans coming together and drinking and celebrating in the streets will lead to a bunch of issues. And there will be public affection (which is illegal there) and I bet money there will be at least one incident of police arresting a gay couple and some people might go missing.
