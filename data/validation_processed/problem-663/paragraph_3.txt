I would love to sit here and point out the nearly infinite number of holes in your joke of an argument, but it would be wasted on you. I will say that the reasons people turned on Chavez were completely legitimate and at no time has Lula EVER come close to the absurd shenanigans that Chavez pulled. I will also say that had Chavez gone around raiding and locking up the greedy degenerate short-sighted assholes burning down the rainforest I would STILL support his decision to do that.
