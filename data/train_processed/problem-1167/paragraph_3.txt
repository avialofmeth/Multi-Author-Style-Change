The large amounts of economic migrant deaths are attributable less to el muro and more to the total lack of mass transit within Mexico, let alone safe and dignified transit. Mexico eliminated it's passenger trains when it privatized their network in '94 to join NAFTA. This immediately destroyed all towns built upon the railroad, destroyed all heavy industries not purchased by Americans, and shoved millions onto an extremely incapable road network. It is one of the largest drivers of systematic inequality in Mexico. Mexico's current President is trying to rebuild it, but how far he gets is ultimately up to Americans.
