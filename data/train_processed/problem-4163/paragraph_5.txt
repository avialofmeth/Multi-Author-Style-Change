As far as most basic Polish Rule of Law is concerned what PiS does is using existing interpretations (and distorting) to get to expected result, but using established concepts that itself cannot be challenged: supremacy of Constitution, prerogative (exclusive and final \[maybe with exception to Tribunal of State\] power) of President in certain (very limited) duties (that also include final 'vote' on judge nominations - that gives judge his status as judge), finality of CT rulings - these are literal. what EU does is using interpretation that was never accepted in Poland (as it would invalidate the treaties) is essentially throwing the baby out with bathwater - it would lead into legal black hole - that can end only with we don't acknowledge (1) primacy (PiS is not exclusive in this one - the biggest opposition party most often than back when they were in power simply hid topic under carpet - they even tried to do the same during PiS vs EU but then EU explicitly came out with "yes we mean primacy" which made hard to advance KO's : "No EU did not meant for Constitution to be less important than EU law") or Polexit except more like PolneverinEU (2) - with legal implications of all EU deals, transactions, laws. judgements ... \- everything about EU was illegal - No government would accept that - so (1): it's EU overreach.
