I don't think you understand the degree to which I've ignored soccer. It wasn't even an option for youth sports when I was growing up, and it's pretty easy to not hear a word about soccer in the US if you don't intentionally seek it out. Though I do work with a few hardcore soccer fans nowadays and am actually somewhat exposed to soccer talk.
