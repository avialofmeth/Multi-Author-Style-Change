They'd have to have quarantine camps and say someone's kid was sick, those parents would try to protect them and keep them at home and in the process cause the spread to worsen. Nobody would want to be near anyone sick, not even some doctors, so it would be difficult for the infected to get food and supplies without infecting others.
