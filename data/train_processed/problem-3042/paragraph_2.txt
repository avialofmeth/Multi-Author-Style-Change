While this was in Israeli court the IDF provided a series of satelite images in which there was no sign of human presence. The masafer yatta's moved on to claim in court they lived in caves and used the area for agricultural purposes, mainly sheep herding. The IDF proposed a compromise in which some of the area will be used for agriculture, both growing crops and herding, the palestinians rejected the compromise.
