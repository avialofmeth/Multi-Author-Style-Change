Mass imprisonment and executions have been used by Russia, China, N Korea, and other nations to effectively control their country. It looks like they're banking of the making an example approach. 15K is relatively small when it comes to government mass executions, but announcing the executions vs disappearing people is relatively uncommon. If this were China, they'd publically execute 3 people and quietly execute 100K over this protest all the while claiming they champion human rights, but I guess Iran has a different culture.
