I checked, jes sanguinis in Bangladesh does not need to be requested. It's automatically granted as long as the mother is Bangladeshi. It DOES need to be requested if the bloodline is through the father, or it's jus soli. And since they do not need to give up citizenship for dual citizenship ( nor does the UK ), it's not something that's going to go away.
