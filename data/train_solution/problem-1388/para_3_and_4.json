    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "The sentence structures in both texts are fairly similar in terms of complexity and length. Both texts exhibit coherence and cohesion in presenting their arguments. However, the second text displays slightly more erratic sentence arrangement, impacting overall quantitative features.",

        "explanation": "The linguistic analysis suggests that while there are some commonalities in punctuation style and discourse features, there are notable distinctions in lexical and grammatical features, sentence structure, and narrative style between the two texts. The presence of more informal and aggressive lexicon in the second text, along with differing sentence arrangements, indicates a lower likelihood of the same authorship.",
