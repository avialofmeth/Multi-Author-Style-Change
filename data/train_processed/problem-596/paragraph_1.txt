It's hilarious how many people thought this guy was dangerous. All those conservatives were like "we got a basketball player and they got the merchant of death!". He was in prison for like 20 fucking years. He's got no money, he's got no inventory, and his network doesn't exist anymore, like what's he going to do? Literally all he is, is an old man with a shitty past.
