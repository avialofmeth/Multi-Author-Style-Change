Thought I was reading a post from /r/WhatCouldGoWrong for a second. Maybe rich people should stop hanging around snowy mountains and start helping us to salvage a future on this mess we call a planet? They can start by reading what the Bible says about sharing your wealth (and properly paying taxes). And I mean the real Bible (KJV), not the corrupted crusades, pope, kiddy molesting Catholic Bible.
