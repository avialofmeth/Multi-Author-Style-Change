There are no national laws making homosexuality illegal in Indonesia, and there are many places where LGBT are relatively safe, free, and open about their sexualidad. Of course, just because it is legal doesn't mean that it is socially acceptable, and outside of the major cities and outside of the non-Islamic islands, most LGBT have to be very discrete for fear of discrimination, shunning, or even violence.
