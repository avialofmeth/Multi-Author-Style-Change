My husband got sent home 3 times after being given Morphin we spent 3-hours in the waiting room each time. I told them it was CES the second time by the 4th time going they finally agreed to and MRI...he had lost feeling in his legs. The neurosurgeon demanded he be mediovacted to Calgary....they did surgery on him as soon as he arrived. At any second he would of been permanently damaged and unable to walk the rest of his life. He's still recovering and has issues with complete numbness that could of been prevented.
