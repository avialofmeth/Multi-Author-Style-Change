I am a 100% disabled veteran and my income rises with the SS COLA, and I am here to tell you that since pandemic was announced April of 2020 our total increases have amounted to 15.6% when REAL inflation just for the basics I have no choice but to purchase is nothing less than 40%. Now you want to come to us and say tough shit, the rich need more tax cuts so we are going to put you old poors out on the street.
