It’s honestly much worse than the previous government. All of the issues from 1979 still exist: lack of political freedom, lack of artistic freedom, no free press, mandatory hijab… which is basically just the same but opposite of the Shahs idea to ban hijab, political violence and repression. They’re just worse now because this government is more evil than Pahlavi’s.
