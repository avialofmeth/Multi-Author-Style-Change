That precedent has already existed for decades - UN members have been annexing territory acquired via military operations quite frequently despite it being inadmissible by UN Charter. Still, a certain superpower does not care for international law but instead torpedoes international law and institutions, rips up treaties, pushes for this so called "rules-based international order" (everyone follow the superpower's rules). Violating international law or shielding allies violating international law has always presented this danger of setting terrible precedent - when the bad guys do it the legal framework is already in tatters. Then the only hope will be that the "good guys" can beat the "bad guys" into submission.
