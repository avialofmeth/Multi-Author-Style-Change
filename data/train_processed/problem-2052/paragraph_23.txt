Where we had centrist senior democrats, we got progressives taking over those seats. Where we had Conservative Republicans before, we got Centrist Democrats. That's a complete shift. The point being, the shift begins with aiming high for what we truly want; and that's how you forget what the Right wants and cares and think about what energizes Democrats to turn out. It's funny how everyone recognizes the down-ballot effect but doesn't consider the notion that one demographic can influence several others, even if they don't themselves turn out to vote in large numbers.
