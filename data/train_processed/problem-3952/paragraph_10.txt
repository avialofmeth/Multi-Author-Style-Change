Third- This might be a long shot, but until the Gerrymandering can be rectified permanently, we as a country need to get more people involved in the voting process. Make it easier to do, like from our phones (with a verification process of coarse-banking, or IRS, or much like a passport) we do everything else with our phones, we might as well vote. Think of how many more people would be in that pool now. This would offset the current gerrymandered counties. More legislation regarding all of this will take time and technology, but it is doableâ€¦and our country deserves it.
