Of course not. He’s only opposed to other people being educated. He’s been trying to tear down public education forever. As dumb as he sounds plays on tv, he’s not stupid. He only has to appear slightly smarter than the yokels that vote for him. Then they’ll believe that education isn’t as important as education hey once thought. And those same voters could never afford the private education system that desantis is trying to build and control. The king game is to create young voters with no critical thinking skills that will follow blindly and vote red.
