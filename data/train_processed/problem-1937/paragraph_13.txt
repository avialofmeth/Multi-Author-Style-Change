It's okay to think Macron is wrong, but I also think there's merit in allowing him to speak, if Vladimir Putin thinks he has an off-ramp he might try to use it, if he doesn't think he has an off-ramp he won't even look. Putin withdrawing from the war is the longest of long shots, but it's also still the best possible outcome for this conflict.
