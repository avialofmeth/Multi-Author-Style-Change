Most don't even consider that as a holiday - just a free day off work. In fact, Christmas is lower in "tier list" of holidays than Easter. Namely because Easter does have some traditions (painting eggs and going out with family to sort of picnic) which is why more non-religious people actually get involved in celebrations, while with Christmas - unless your family and/or your close circle is religious - no one cares much.
