A lot of NATO weapons and supplies goes thru Romania. Our current prime minister, even tho we dont like him as a politician, is a decorated army general who fought mainly in Kandahar as part of NATO against the “war on terrorism”. Even mr Kuleba said that Romania is doing a good job in helping Ukraine. So yea, besides logistics we also gave some of our soviet stuff.
