A guy at work stuck his head in a nitrogen filled tank, immediately passed out and fell backward. When he woke up he said he didn't remember a thing. He was lucky because even though he passed out he wasn't brain dead so his breathing response was still working and his next breath brought in a lungful of oxygen rich air.
