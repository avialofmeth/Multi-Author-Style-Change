I mean I was pretty positive toward Russia some years ago. I've studied there, I can speak Russian language and I've studied their economic history and how to do business with them. The potential should have been huge and I too believed doing business with them and tying our interests together was bound to build peace and understanding. I still can't fathom why it all changed especially when everything they now do will effectively ruin their economy, reputation and future as a nation.
