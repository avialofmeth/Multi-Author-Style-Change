This could be the breaking point in the trajectory of the war. If Ukraine is really ready to fight something more like a set battle, they should consider ways of softening up the enemy or making the ground muddier or preparing the event by starting the fight early with various ways of making it a very difficult path for Russia. The ground itself should be their enemy. Thinks like trenches for tanks to get stuck in, Patriot batteries to kill in-coming rockets, like the "Surrender Hotline" to get Russian soldiers to surrender and thus ruin their unit cohesion, those are the types of things to undermine and destroy any Russian offensive.
