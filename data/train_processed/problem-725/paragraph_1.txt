But here’s the deal, China doesn’t care about Taiwan itself or its people enough to risk such a difficult operation. It’s more about the semiconductor factories, so “destroy it and leave it in ashes” is the opposite of what China wants. Oh and did I mention that these factories require people with very niche knowledge? Like “only the Taiwanese person who has been working on this factory for the past 20 years knows how to do it” niche knowledge. So not only do they need to capture the island which is hard as is, they should do it in a way that won’t damage the factories and won’t endanger civilians.
