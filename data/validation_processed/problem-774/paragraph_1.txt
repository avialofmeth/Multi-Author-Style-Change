I work at a delivery service that has been around for 300 years or so? We have people who've put in 10 years plus who are either leaving or going medical-8. I know people who have already made double their salary in overtime and penalty time because we have been that short staffed with "peak season volume" all goddamn year since covid. We have zero holiday help. We are going into the third year of the worst peak season ever ( I keep hearing the word "unprecedented") and yet not a fucking peep from up top.
