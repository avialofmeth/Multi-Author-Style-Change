As for drugs, it is the same issue but we can at least vote to change our policies at the local and national level and change is happening right now because any individual can be a catalyst for real change in America, even if it doesn’t happen right away. Meanwhile, in Qatar even just possessing drugs will put you in jail for a long time while in US only selling drugs will put you in jail for most time. As for sending people to rehab, that is better than jail and a system Qatar also doesn’t have.
