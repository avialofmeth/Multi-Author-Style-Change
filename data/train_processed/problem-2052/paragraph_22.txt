It was the youth that canvassed, phone-banked, and fundraised. It was the grassroots organization and Obama's youth outreach and progressive (for the time) positioning that led to a GOTV movement. Keep in mind the youth's actual vote turnout alone (which DID see an uptick in the years I mentioned no less) isn't the only factor: it's how influential they are at pushing others to vote, and pushing back against the online right-wing narrative from social media to comments. If they aren't enthused, then they'll let liars run their mouths and control the narrative of the election.
