Ukraine’s favored tactic this war has been rope-a-dope. Right now Russia is full of strenh from the mobiks raised in the fall. Ukraine is letting Russia bleed men to get a few feet of ground, while generally preserving its own strenh. Once Russia exhausts the mobiks, which should happen soon since the current wave of mobiks have been thrown at Bakhmut in heavy waves for almost a month now. Russia officially raised 300,000 and sent half to Ukraine, concentrating them at Bakhmut and Soledar. If a force is meaningless when it has one man dead in ten and Russia loses 500 a day, Russia can’t go much longer with the current wave. That’s Ukraine’s cue to start pushing.
