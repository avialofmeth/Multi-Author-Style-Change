The F-35 was different. The F-35 was developed in the Joint Strike Fighter program and was intended to be a plane that all NATO countries would have access to. The US went to all of these countries and told them that if they helped fund its development (via the JSF Fund) they would get first dibs on it and they could also bid to manufacture parts for the jets. Canada and UK were the first to invest in this program but as it got more serious in its development phase other countries signed on. Ironically Canada turned down the first batch of F-35s 7 years ago at a reduced price over national fears of having a functional military.
