It’s hard for me to try and process/understand that sort of mentality. Especially in America. I have faith in the younger generation that is hitting voting age, grew up with school shootings and seeing republicans do nothing to protect them. I graduated in ‘02 and my generation is just shit. I’ve also chosen to live in a blue state and a blue county. Living somewhere that shares the same goals for the future of the country, world, environment, etc. was a conscious choice.
