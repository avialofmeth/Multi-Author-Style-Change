If I wanted 'good' medical care, I could tack on another $300 a month for a concierge practice which would mean I could get same day appointments and priority treatment in an ER. That means I'll be paying $10,000 per year for medical care and 100% of the drug bill as I don't have Part D - which is a ripoff - or $6,500 a year for mediocre medical care.
