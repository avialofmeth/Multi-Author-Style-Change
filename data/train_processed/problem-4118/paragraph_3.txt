this is based off of official UNHCR refugees, not just asylum seekers, which sounds like the number you’re using for Germany. Even then, the US has over 50 million immigrants, which is more than half of Germany’s population, so I would estimate the US has well over 3 million asylum seekers as well - especially given that 2.1 million people applied at the border last year alone.
