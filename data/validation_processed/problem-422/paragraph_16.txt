What is much more likely (and some say already attempted) is trying to file lawsuits against Russia, and use these frozen assets as compensation for damages the lawful way. But that’s not something that can be done quickly, and very likely will not happen before the conflict is resolved (one way or the other). And by the time that happens... Who’s to say what the situation will be like.
