The truth is a great deal of how the I/P conflict is covered is due to media's ability to operate in the region. It gets arguably undue attention because it's a relatively safe middle east conflict to report on, especially from within Israel. And in Israel you can be for or against the Israeli government's actions, while if you're reporting from the West Bank or Gaza opposing the governments can be dangerous and resuli in violence, arrest, etc.
