The article does have one highly misleading—even arguably wrong—statement: It states “The stretch of land became part of the Qing empire in 1689, under the Treaty of Nerchinsk,” however the territory only became part of the Qing Empire in the eyes of Europe; it was already an ancestral part of their empire in the eyes of the Qing, who considered the Russians invaders. The Qing was, after all, a Manchurian dynasty, so it’s a bit incredible to think they would have left half of their Manchuria, their homeland, unclaimed.
