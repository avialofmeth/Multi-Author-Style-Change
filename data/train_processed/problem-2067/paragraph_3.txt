My irish celtic ancestors were kidnapped by vikings and sold into slavery in arabia for hundreds of years to moors /ottoman empire ...slavery is still there- ..appalling fanaticism ..clan tribal wars are all still there ..time for rich oil countries to stop suppressing their own and stop blaming west for common human behavior thats in all of their own history..my point about cowardly young people coming to EU for free benefits, welfare is true .
