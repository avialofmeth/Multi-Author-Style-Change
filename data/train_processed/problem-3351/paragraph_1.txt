Don’t panic … it is very unlikely that you’ll contract those protovirus. Those virus was very big in size and humanity was exposed to it for a verrryyyy long period. In our genome we also find adaptations dating back to those viruses. Mostly animal related too. We are mostly shielded against them since the first ages so stop panicking. Paranoia is the nitrofuel of conspiracy !
