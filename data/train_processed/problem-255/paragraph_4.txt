And secondly - things can change with time. For example, 500 years ago if you wanted to drink or cook with almond-based replacement for milk (and yeah - I didn't know they had those but I literally read it from the Shulchan Aruch - which was written in Safed in the 16th century...), Anyway you had to put almonds with the milk or with the stew or whatever it is - so people would understand that it's not real milk.
