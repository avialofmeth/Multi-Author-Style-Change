I am Palestinian. We do not care for whoâ€™s originally at fault, the fact of the matter is the Zionists come into our homes, and forcefully take them. My family had their home taken and then cannot leave the country without Israeli permission, cannot buy a car without exorbitant taxes to Israel, cannot do jack shit with dealing with Israel.
