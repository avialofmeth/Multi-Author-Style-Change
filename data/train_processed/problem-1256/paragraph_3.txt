Because ignoring the reality that 40%+ of the population supports the white hegemony systems which are incompatible with a modern pluralist state and are unlikely to change their views is helping? The data that the views of people rarely change after age 25 is pretty strong. I would rather have no illusions that this is going to be a long fight for decades which will probably only end through the slow attrition of social conservatives. It does no one any good to pretend otherwise.
