I hate how prosecutors use the threat of indictments to get witnesses to cooperate, either they committed a crime by breaking the law or they did not. Leniency for cooperation should ONLY be available during sentencing, not for indictments. One of the best recent example of this is Jeffrey Epsteinâ€™s NPA. Another example is the prosecution of Cohen while Trump walks free.
