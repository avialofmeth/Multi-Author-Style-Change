I don't know why this is surprising to people. Most people across Africa have a deep distrust for the "West" and would rather support our enemy's enemy. It certainly didn't help public perception when Obama threatened to place sanctions on South Africa back in 2015. Also, for most South Africans, the Ukraine conflict is just one of many far away conflicts going on in this world and is barely even covered on the news or media in SA. There's already too much drama in SA for most people to concern themselves about something happening 5000 miles away in another continent.
