Russia is a terrorist and fascist country and should be treated as such (the government mostly) and though ussr helped India it hurt and infringed autonomous countries that bordered it, did similar things that nazis did. And now these days they’re trying to do the same, to bring back the ussr and cause terror to other countries. Ukraine was and is an autonomous country and doesn’t belong to Russia and the countries that join NATO joins it out of their own free will. But whatever believe the brainwashing instead I don’t care, truth is truth so no matter how many times you’ll spew lies a lie won’t become the truth.
