On that note too, Soviet vehicles have also been known to be maintenance heavy, which is impacting both Ukraine and Russia. Capturing abandoned vehicles only does so much for Ukraine, since even in the best case, such as the crew abandoning the vehicle from running out of fuel, much of what they can salvage will be limited as Russia's poor quality and maintenance means that components all over the vehicle can range from inoperable to nearly broken. Occasionally they may find parts in good condition, which they almost certainly pull from the captured vehicles to use in their already existing stockpile. NATO vehicles, in contrast, have been held to a higher quality standard and have been kept up with maintenance even when in storage for years. Meaning they are more likely to be in working order, and will arrive with the parts to keep them running.
