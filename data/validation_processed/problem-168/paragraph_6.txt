The fact that McLeod-Skinner finished just a few points behind the Republican despite getting left for dead by the rest of the party pretty strongly suggests that decision was a mistake. Obviously there's no way to no for sure what would have happened, but it seems like if she had gotten a little bit of support from Democratic campaign organizations we could have gotten another seat in the house.
