Your suggestion has nothing to do with Israeli national security and keeping their own citizens safe. Unless you think the reason for violence and reliation is the settlement building which is beyond stupid. If you want to pull the settlement building fact out of your ass to say "If Israel didn't do X they wouldn't have to deal with such retaliation" you are very wrong. In fact, you are the one currently deflecting blame and somehow believing that this conflict is simply about land ownership and rights to land that has passed hands between empires and nations for millennia, and doesn't have anything to do with the fact that Hamas et al are extremist groups who will enact violence in any situation.
