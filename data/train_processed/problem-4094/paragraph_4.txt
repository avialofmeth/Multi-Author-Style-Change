We have to do better by young women in these situations. Just as an example, we used to partner with another fairly clueless organization that provided by bicycles to girls in rural areas to get to and from school because that was their major barrier. The boys either already had bikes or had access to motorized vehicles of some sort, or even more schools close enough to walk to. That wasn't enough. The families were so crushingly poor that they couldn't be seen as providing anything "extra" to something as "useless" as a girls education so they sold the bikes to buy food or necessities. Or, in the saddest cases, they just gave the bikes to the boys even though they didn't "need" them, It was just a cultural expectation that the boys received whatever they wanted that the parents could provide.
