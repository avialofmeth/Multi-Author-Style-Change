Writing from Oregon, I didn't really follow the measure until I got the voter's guide and read it. Then it was just a big sigh...that thing is going to make a lot of lawyers rich. It's the one thing on the ballot I didn't bother to fill out. I almost wonder if it wasn't done for publicity or political points, not to actually pass a good or useful law.
