More than that, Western countries and their allies need to band together against Chinese bullying. They have played a successful game of picking off individual countries to punish them for various "transgressions" (visit by Dalai Lama, Taiwan, etc.). We need some kind of economic NATO against China to counter that behavior and make it more costly to China. And urgently, reduce our reliance for manufacturing on them. It was a mistake to let them in the WTO. I'd rather have respect for human rights and international law and norms than cheap trinkets from that shit country (which it is under Xi).
