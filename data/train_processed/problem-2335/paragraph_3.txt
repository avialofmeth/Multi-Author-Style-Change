I think the unions' demands have been pretty well demarcated here. We know what they want, and it isn't really unreasonable. Congress could also settle this labor dispute by forcing the company to give the unions 100% of what they're asking for. Why isn't that on the table? If anyone proposes that, the Chamber of Commerce would scream bloody murder about the government forcing a business to accept an unwanted contract.
