Every year when I was a kid, my local town would have a vote on the education budget and the people who only care about themselves would vote against school music bands, library resources , field trips, healthy food in the cafeteria, etc.. you get the picture. Then the rest of the town would come out in late August to revote and the normal budget would once again be passed to allocate funds where needed.
