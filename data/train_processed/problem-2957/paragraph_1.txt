I’m an Iranian who immigrated to Europe with my family when I was 11 years old. I was against the hijab since a young age but I was forced to wear it in school. You would get punished if you were showing your HAIR. They told me I would be killed and thrown into jail if I don’t cover my hair, body or be non Muslim.
