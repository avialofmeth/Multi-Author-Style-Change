Uhhh... Sounds like a waste of time, but you go ahead and get that laptop that definitely exists from Tucker Carlson and you go ahead and see what's definitely for realsies on that thing and then trace the provenance of that item, which definitely totally exists because some very important and trustworthy people like Rudy have said so, and you prove that it was definitely Hunter's and not just some bullshit. And then from there you go ahead and take the president's son's supposed actions detailed in this device, which definitely totally exists I promise bigly and you can't see it but I promise it is real, and you go ahead and prove that Joe was involved in whatever it is that supposedly is in this thing that definitely really exists.
