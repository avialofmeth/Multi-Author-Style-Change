The Overton window in the US has steadily been marching leftward over the past 20 years or so. Manchin voted for a gargantuan stimulus that massively dwarfed the 2009 stimulus, and also voted for the biggest climate bill in history, which also expanded healthcare and reformed prescription drugs. He may not be as liberal as we'd like but he's no conservative.
