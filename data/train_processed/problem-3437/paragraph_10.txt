Putin has specifically created a state apparatus wherein his demise would ensure the rise of a silovnik, who would likely be as or more deranged than him. Therefore he positions himself in a role where the public actually wants to keep him lest someone else fuck things up more. The issue at Russia's core is the fact that there are no good statesmen, No good candidate to take the helm. Navalny is not a lesser evil, just a different populist type. And frothing at the mouth to get rid of Putin, the evil we know, is myopic.
