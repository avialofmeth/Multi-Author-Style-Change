China really ruined their own chances by stealing everything they could from the west and producing shit knock offs instead of innovating on their own. The US is the sole reason why China is the powerhouse it is today and instead of working together, they stab the US in the back every chance they get. And that's not even touching on the fact that their current regime is perfectly fine disappearing citizens who speak out, slave labor, and literal concentration camps for people they don't like. Even right now they're drooling at the thought of invading Taiwan and stealing the machines used to produce semiconductors because they're incapable of producing them on their own.
