    "feature1": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit consistent use of punctuation marks such as colons, commas, and periods. However, no specific unique punctuation style is evident to strongly link the texts together.",
        "score": 0.6
    },
    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "The texts share a similar level of lexical variation and word choice. Both use formal language and historical context, but there are no distinct common lexical or grammatical features that strongly connect the texts.",
        "score": 0.5
    },
    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "Sentence structure in both texts is relatively complex with coherent and cohesive progression. There is a similarity in sentence length and arrangement; however, the lack of specific quantitative features hinders a strong connection.",
        "score": 0.6
    },
    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Both texts exhibit a formal narrative style with a serious and informative tone. They share common expressions related to historical events. However, there are no unique discourse features that strongly tie the texts together.",
        "score": 0.6
    },
    "feature5": {
        "explanation": "There are no apparent spelling or typographical errors in either text, indicating a level of attention to detail. However, this commonality is not distinct enough to strongly suggest the same author.",
        "score": 0.6
    },
    "overall": {
        "explanation": "Based on an assessment of the identified features, the likelihood that the two texts were written by the same author is moderate. While there are some commonalities in punctuation, sentence structure, and tone, the lack of distinct shared features reduces the overall confidence in authorship.",
