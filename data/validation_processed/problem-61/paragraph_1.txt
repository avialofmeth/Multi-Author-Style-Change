Republicans made it a point to elect inexperienced and uneducated legislators with extremist tendencies to "drain the swamp" only to engage in the highest degree of cronyism in our nation's history. They're on a self fulfilling prophecy of destroying the government through their inability to govern and deliberate sabotage of our institutions. The IRS didn't even finish the mandated audits of Trump because they only had one person on the case.
