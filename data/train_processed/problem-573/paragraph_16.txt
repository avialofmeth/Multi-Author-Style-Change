I haven’t heard it described in the terms « Republican orthodoxy » before but I really like that term and I think it sums it up so well. Business suit, check. Lip service to Christian values, check. Regressive social and fiscal polices, check. Even a hat and slogan for the NASCAR type fans to wear around, check. No wonder it’s popular.
