Ben-Gvir's sudden electoral power doesn't come from his position on Judea and Samaria, Temple mount or even judicial system. His election campaign was all about internal security. This is what gave him the power in these elections and this what he will try to deliver. Of cause he will try to implement everything else Otzma Yehudit stends for, but those wouldn't be the "red lines", simply because this is not what most of his voters sent him to do. And achieving proper internal security is something that every party in the coalition support, so this wouldn't put him into collision course with anyone.
