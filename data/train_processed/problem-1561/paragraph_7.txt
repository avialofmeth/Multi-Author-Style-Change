I donâ€™t think being anti soviet is comparable with being anti Russian. It is closer to being anti Chinese today. I see this come up a bunch some times and it ignores that the Soviet government collapsed and no longer exists. The closest to a successor state, Russia, has always had pretty far right alignments so of course republicans are more aligned to it.
