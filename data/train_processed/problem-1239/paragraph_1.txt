No, they fucking can't. Jesus Christ you guys. It's not remotely that simple. Most of these troops are miles behind the front line getting killed from artillery, cold, illness and drone grenades. People at the actual front are watched by death squads that have orders to kill anyone who tries to surrender, and if you are caught trying to surrender you will be subjected to torture. Not to mention there is a decent chance you get killed by accidental Ukrainian fire while surrendering, or get accidentally traded back to Russia and tortured to death and punishment. This isn't a game you can just opt out of. This is a fucking cruel, inhuman nightmare, and none of you have any idea how you would handle it if you were in their place.
