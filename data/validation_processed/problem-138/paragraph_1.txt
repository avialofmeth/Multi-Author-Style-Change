No, they've been sending lost of their own fairly-limited equipment stocks to Ukraine, as well. Poland sent virtually all of their T-72 tanks at the start of the war, several NATO members have severely drained their stocks of SPGs to equip Ukraine, all kinda of tech, maintenance, intel support has been provided by virtually every western ally, and not even mentioning all the consumable materials sent by basically everyone, MREs, water, basic infantry equipment, plenty of small arms, probably almost every kind of missile launcher ever made in some quantity or another, and all that's just off the top of my head.
