Or do you want to reread my comment and see that I don't even question the opinion of any chef, I'm just mocking the point that it's still a fast food place with a really low bar. He's being hyperbolic and his comment is taken out of context by the headline. He's giving a compliment to a local McDs for trying to elevate the garbage food they produce and he likes the effort compared to the lower-end product McDs usually delivers.
