We revere mass murderers, billionaires and the worst humanity has to offer all the time. To change how people view power hungry maniacs you need to do an honest accounting of history and tell the stories of how the people that destroyed lives, towns and cities weâ€™re disgusting and vile people instead of continuously holding them up on a pedestal. If you do that then people like Putin would never exist. He exist because his behavior is what has been acceptable in Russia and the rest of the world for thousands of years.
