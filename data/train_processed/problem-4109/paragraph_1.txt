Yep. I woke up today at 03:00 and worked in 50C conditions for 18 hours, was fed scraps, and was beaten (yet again) for trying to escape out of the slave camp. I've got a tooth infection that's getting worse, and I can't get any medical attention so I'm thinking about just ripping out the tooth before it spreads.
