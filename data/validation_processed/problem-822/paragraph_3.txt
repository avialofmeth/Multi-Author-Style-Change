People on the right always think this, but publicly traded corporations don't have any kind of politics or morals, they just exist to make money and will proceed in whichever manner best achieves that. This is because those companies have boards that answer to the shareholders, so if whatever decisions the CEO and board make cause the share price to go down, they'll get fired and replaced with people who will make the prices go back up.
