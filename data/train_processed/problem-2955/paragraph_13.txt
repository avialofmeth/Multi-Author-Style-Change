You're assuming their numbers are a net negative, but their numbers may be cancelled out by the people who join knowing the military takes their health seriously. I'm not disputing that people are being insubordinate or that they don't want to join over vaccines. I'm saying there's no evidence it's a harming recruitment, and a claim without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
