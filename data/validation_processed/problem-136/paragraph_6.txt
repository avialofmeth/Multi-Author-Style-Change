Discussing politics, the ebb and flow of the house membership could have significant ramifications. If Steube is medically sidelined, Devolder/Santos ejected for an illegitimacy (certainly possible), and Virginia replaces McEachin in February, that's 220-213. For something like raising the debt ceiling without having to mint a trillion dollar coin, convincing 4 Republicans to buck their party might be doable.
