this seems like a particularly shitty way to spy since it's uncontrollable and really fucking high up. the idea that it's doing signals intel doesn't seem too likely since they're on a randomish path and I can't imagine there's a whole lot of unencrypted radio chatter going on these days. when you've got low orbit spy sats that can be directed over anything these balloons being anything serious strikes me as pretty unlikely. plus Greene is super pissed about it and that makes me think it's a ball of nothing.
