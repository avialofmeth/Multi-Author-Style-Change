His academic history is also very suspect. He claims to have been in a PhD program, but there is no evidence of that. He likely never completed an undergraduate degree, yet he claims to have two (he's told different, conflicting stories about this over the years). He claims that his educational background in physics, engineering, computers, etc makes him a legit engineer, but his university studies were in economics. It's possible that he violated the terms of his student visa by leaving his university to move to California with his brother to start a business; so he might have been an illegal immigrant for a time and violated numerous laws when starting his business career.
