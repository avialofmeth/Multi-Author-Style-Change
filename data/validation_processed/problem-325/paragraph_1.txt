You say this pact had the goal of fighting fascism, of which the USSR was truly based on. Talk about spouting drivel. Stalin was out to protect himself above all else. This move to court Europe was to improve trade, nothing more. The USSR (and all other countries) are always actively promoting national ties, that's their job. What Stalin did behind closed doors may or may not have abided by any promises, or insinuations, he made with them. Stalin was a very inept leader that was mostly concerned about preserving himself, he would have made promises to anyone for that goal. Try and learn world politics and history before spouting off on here. It will save you some embarrassment.
