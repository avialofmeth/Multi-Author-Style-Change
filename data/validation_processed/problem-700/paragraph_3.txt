They cannot allow such a ridiculous law--the ability to overrule the High Court with a simple majority--to pass. It would mean that the legislative can ignore any and every law, to the point of even getting rid of democracy altogether. Such a law won't make Israel undemocratic, but it will enable an autocratic takeover, which means it cannot be allowed to pass because it threatens Israel's democracy.
