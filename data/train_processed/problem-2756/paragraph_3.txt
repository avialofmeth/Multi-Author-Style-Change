That being said, I'm not surprised - the fallout from China's one child policy is the gift that keeps on giving. Massive gender imbalance, women that have no interest in marrying and/or having children because they fear it would threaten their career, and China's elderly literally suing their children over neglect because the traditional stay-at-home daughter (in law) is no longer there.
