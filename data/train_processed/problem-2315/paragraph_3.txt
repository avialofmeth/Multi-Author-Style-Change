One also has to make bail/bond or have a short and minor enough history to make a PR bond (personal recognizance—they just trust you to show up to court and impose a fee (and warrant) if you don’t). Last time I bonded out was $1000. You get that back for showing up, but, ah, it’s tough to pull a sudden grand out of thin air.
