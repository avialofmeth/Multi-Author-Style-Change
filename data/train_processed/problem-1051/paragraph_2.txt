The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine. It is astounding. "Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals. You are morally obligated to let us kill you.".
