The circuits used for Christmas lighting would not be suitable to be used to charge vehicles. There is code that has to be followed. Christmas lighting does not exist on every street with parking. The infrastructure has to be built, you cant just point to Christmas lights and go yes they exist, proof of concept. Or pretend you can splice into that circuit. You have to run power from transformers to underground conduit and install charging stations at every parking spots all throughout the city if you plan on a future with a high adoption rate of battery powered evs. That means tearing up all the sidewalks and streets in the city and re-asphalting them.
