I'm not sure you are aware but innocent journalists die in the middle of conflicts all the time, this isn't something new and it is something that the journalists are well aware of. They know they are in danger when reporting from conflict zones. Israel was there to apprehend terrorists who had been murdering innocent civilians all summer when they were fired upon by those terrorists.
