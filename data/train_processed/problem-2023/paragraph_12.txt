It’s was Karl Marx in Das Kapital that popularized capitalism and not Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations. If you read Wealth of Nations you would understand that whatever broken system the US is under is not what Adam Smith intended anyways. He detested landlords as well as the gentry from right prior to the French Revolution with their unrestricted attitudes. Scandinavia has a better working model and there is no reason others can’t follow suit. Why can’t we reimagine a capitalist or socialist structure that works for us?
