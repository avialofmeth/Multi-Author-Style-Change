As hosts? Not really. Bill O'Reilly was for sure. Megyn Kelly was. However, Glenn Beck was immensely entertaining. He was a lunatic, eventually certifiably so, but he wasn't bland. Hannity isn't really a neocon. He's a nationalist. Ingraham is too. Greta Van Susteren doesn't really believe in anything and never has. Many of their former cadre of analysts and contributors like George Will or Bill Krystal were very much exceedingly bland neocons, eventhough I admit I actually had a bit of a soft spot for Will.
