It's slightly a relief but still more frustrating to know it was such a widespread phenomenon, I remember it didn't pass over me despite being a kid because it impacted videogame prices too: from sixty thousands of our previous currency to 60â‚¬ (basically doubled), having learned by heart the exchange rate of the two since it was often on TV I couldn't help but thinking those game store owners were either very lacking math-wise or very greedy.
