You guys have no idea how much we wish we had the basic freedom of the west. Girls want to wear whatever they want without being jailed. Students want boys and girls to be allowed in the same classrooms. We want to access the internet and social media sites like YouTube without having to use a VPN. Couples want to hold hands in Public without the fear of morality police arresting them.
