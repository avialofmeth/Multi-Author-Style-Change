It wasn't the worst. By magnitude, the top 8 are all up in Alaska. Two of those, plus two more in California that were close in magnitude, had higher death tolls than the New Madrid ones. That said, another Missouri EQ of similar strenh could absolutely become the deadliest if it hit the right place - and regardless of fatalities the devastation would be tremendous. Scary shit considering you guys are nowhere near a fault line!
