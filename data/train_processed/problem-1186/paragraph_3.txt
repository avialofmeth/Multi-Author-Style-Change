I try to avoid remembering any details regarding the Trump presidency, but it's worth noting here. The reason they were bad for the country wasn't just malice, or hatred, or any of the other shit they did. They were flat-out incompetent by almost every possible measure. They could accidentally explode things that didn't need touched, regularly.
