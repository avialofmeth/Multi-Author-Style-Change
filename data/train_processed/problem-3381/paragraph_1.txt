Don't take my comment to mean that I think Trump and Obama are equals in terms of bad actions. If your read any of my comment history you will see that I have no love for Trump. However, if you are going to make comparisons between bad actions for two parties choose examples that fit. Obama has plenty more to be criticised for, but overall he was a good President. Trump should have been in jail for life 30 years ago for financial crimes.
