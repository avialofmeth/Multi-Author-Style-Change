Due to the fragmented and multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious nature of Indonesia (not to mention the geographical challenges of managing thousands of islands separated by history and language), Indonesia is not as strong of a Federation as the USA. It's not as weak as the EU either, but they have similar issues juggling extremely diverse peoples. In order to prevent actual fragmentation and rebellion (of which there have been several), the central government must be careful as to how they challenge provincial powers.
