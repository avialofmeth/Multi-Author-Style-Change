    "feature1": {
        "explanation": "Paragraph 1 demonstrates the use of multiple punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and a question mark.

        "score": 0.4
    },
    "feature2": {
        "explanation": "In terms of lexical and grammatical features, Paragraph 1 shows a more elaborate and descriptive writing style with phrases like 'fragile ego' and 'rewriting every last bit of his sensory input.' Paragraph 2, being a bot-generated response, is concise and uses technical language related to automated actions.",
        "score": 0.3
    },
    "feature3": {
        "explanation": "Sentence structure and quantitative features in Paragraph 1 include longer, complex sentences with detailed descriptions. In contrast, Paragraph 2 is short and direct, typical of automated responses, lacking complexity.",

    "feature4": {
        "explanation": "Text and discourse features reveal a stark contrast between the two paragraphs. Paragraph 1 expresses a critical and opinionated tone towards a specific individual, while Paragraph 2 is neutral and purely informative as expected from a bot response.",

    },
    "overall": {
        "explanation": "Considering the analysis of the five features, the overall confidence score that the two texts were written by the same author is moderate, as there are notable differences in punctuation style, lexical and grammatical features, sentence structure, and discourse features. The similarity in spelling and lack of typographical errors slightly boost the confidence level.",
