It’s a global issue and the only solution in a capitalist system is to make no changes and be satisfied with becoming a poorer country in the long run, or basically import enough people from around the world to remake your demographic makeup. There are no 3rd options. Robots and automation isn’t going to do fuck all but make like 2 guys in the entire country rich while the rest become service gig slaves.
