Last fun fact on this topic: only the President of Ukraine can approve the removal of citizenship, no one else. He signs a formal document after a person submits a request to do so or after confirmation that they have broken the law. Theyâ€™ve basically halted regular processing of those requests since the beginning of the war, at least I had a friend in the summer who had submitted his docs in January 2022 so that he could gain citizenship of his long-term country of residence but there had been no movement since then. Looks like they did an expedited exception for those priests, good riddance.
