Those balloons fly at 20km. Lowest satellite ever was stabilized at 164km high, but most spy satellites are twice that height. This x16 difference means you can skip on high end camera, and use something much cheaper. And the cost of launch (balloon vs rocket) is night and day as well. Not to mention if you can land it in international water, you can actually salvage it back. This could be cost effective over satellite, or an alternative to satellite.
