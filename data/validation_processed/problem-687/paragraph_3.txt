It hurts them and we need to keep it up, but we also need to be more sober on Russia's own capabilities. I've argued about all this before, and people are always so eager to jump to "We've done it We've defeated Russia No way they get around this Our victory is at hand" but in reality, Russia isn't going to take any of this sitting down, they will search for ways around everything we do, to trick us into believing the opposite of what is happening, and we need to think ahead, instead of coping for a quick win.
