Just judging from the people I've known, the line between the trauma and the pride is sometimes blurry. The training is all designed to dehumanize, both the soldier and the enemy, but people are inherently opposed to killing, these things get mixed up and muddled sometimes. Some people are psychopaths, or have psychopaths easily coaxed out by military training, some people are good and believe the good thing is to kill for the state, to "protect our freedoms", but killing is still horrific, even in clear self defense, even when the enemy is obviously a monster. My grandfather killed many nazis, he was proud of his service and he was traumatized by taking human lives. Pride is an effective coping mechanism for some people, they've done the worst thing a person can do but for the best reasons, or so they might tell themselves. I think it's really complicated, the polarity of "pride vs shame" probably doesn't come anywhere close to encompassing that experience. I have sympathy whether a person is ashamed and traumatized, or whether they're proud and callous, maybe especially if they're proud and callous, that person is truly damaged and there's no clear way back from that.
