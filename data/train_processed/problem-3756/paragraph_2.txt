I'm pretty sure it's false but maybe it'll help the woman claiming that she might possibly be McCann. It seems as if her childhood was very traumatic. I don't think it will blow up in the media though because she's been claiming this since at least 2021 and it's only been picked up by small outlets and tabloids.
