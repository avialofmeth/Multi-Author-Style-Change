Another part of it is that McCarthy doesn't have a clear path to being Speaker, and Santos has said he'd support McCarthy. So McCarthy can't afford to lose even a single vote, but if Santos didn't support him, McCarthy would probably be quick to kick him to the curb to try to get a more friendly Republican in his place.
