That will all depend on domestic politics. There is presently a political problem in the US, that one political party is no longer interested in the state of the empire, only in its position either the empire. Empires at their height tend to develope such factions and they always lead to crisis. If this faction can be defeated, then the US will recover and is likely to become even stronger than it was before. The destruction of this segment of the establishment will create room for "new blood" to join the elite, increasing the vibrancy of the elite. This will increase elite confidence and competency, leading to generally better strategic decision making.
