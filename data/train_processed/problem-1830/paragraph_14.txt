There will 100% be bad actors. Geo-politics alone will dictate that. If that is indeed the route they try to steer it we might see the first internet mass exodus. Whether its networks isolating themselves or people actually trying to relay information in different methods. OR heavily controlled narratives with in real time censorship against opposing views. Pretty dystopian.
