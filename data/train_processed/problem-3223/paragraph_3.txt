Christmas is just a stolen pagan holiday, which is why it's in December and has nothing to do with Jesus' birth. A lot of people will say that they made a Jesus version of the pagan party to be more inclusive, but the opposite is true. The Church (as an arm of political power) was pressured into a December 25th celebration because people were abandoning the church as it was forbidden to celebrate the pagan holiday even though it was so popular.
