With the economic downturn in 2008 republicans were without an agenda to offer any assistance to prove the parties value to the population. You can’t go out to people who don’t have a job and say “yeah well we need to cut taxes on corporations”. So without an agenda they just attacked EVERYTHING Obama did even little things like wearing tan suits or ordering Dijon mustard.
