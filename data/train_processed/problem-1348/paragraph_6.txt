What confuses the fuck out of me is... Legalistically Fox News and specifically Tucker Carlson's show are "entertainment" and no "reasonable person" would suggest they are factual outlets for "news" related information. So why is the house speaker allowed to send national security footage to them? Shouldn't they also have to send it to South Park? Jon Stewart? Colbert? if requested.
