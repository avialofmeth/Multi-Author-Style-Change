I’ll be honest. This past year I’ve been borderline depressed over whether or not we were witnessing the United States’ democracy unravel in real time. While most of these races were/are wayyyy too close, at least I can sleep a little easier knowing that most of the country believes in democracy instead of not. Man this news feels good!
