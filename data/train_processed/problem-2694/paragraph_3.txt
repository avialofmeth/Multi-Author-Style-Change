I’ve never understood the disrespect directed toward her. She never held herself up as an expert. To the best of my knowledge, she hasn’t monetized her position. She, as a member of the first generation who will spend their whole lives dealing with the consequences of our failures (I’m in my 50’s.), has merely been calling us out. Angrily. As well she should. We get angry about the price of gas, and people mock her for being pissed about a lifetime of increasingly expensive catastrophes? SMH.
