Not trying to make light of the situation, but some strains of avian flu can cause rapid shifts of lethargy and mania, the sort of mania that involves attacking anything that comes near them. The mania comes from mild brain swelling that occurs in certain strains. This one seems no different, though so far the human cases have not shown such mania. But if we’re not careful and unlucky enough to start exhibiting such symptoms in human patients, we may essentially end up in a ‘zombie’ scenario.
