OK, you legally own it, but I can only imagine how approaching the mfg for the necessary support would go. It's loaded with the prior patient's program. The mfg hasn't been paid a dime so they've got less incentive to provide support for a new patient- the clinician visit is paid, but the mfg takes on a huge liability in supporting a used implant.
