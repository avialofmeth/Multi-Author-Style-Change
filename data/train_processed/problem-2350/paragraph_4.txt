i think regardless of what happens in ukraine they are already fucked for the whole next generation. russia is a bully nation and now they have to show up to class with two broken legs. the entire way they operate is predicated on being able to back up their open and implied threats. also, nobody will want to buy any war equipment they make for the foreseeable future, cementing the west's supremacy and leaving room for others to grab market share which will probably be permanent.
