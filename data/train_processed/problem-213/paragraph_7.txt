I always follow up with my least favourite thing being the currency, bland, dated, and somehow frequently way behind in payment processing technology despite inventing much of it. It’s shocking how many places still want a physical signature to validate a credit card payment, or were a decade later than anywhere I’ve been in Canada on chip/pin or tap. I like to complain about that occasionally.
