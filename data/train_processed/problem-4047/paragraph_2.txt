Some missiles were apparently intercepted by our air defense, but some did make it through and landed somewhere not too far from Kharkiv. There were reports of electricity being cut in some places in Kharkiv oblast, so Russians were most likely aiming for our energy infrastructure as usual. Our air defense is definitely getting better/more skilled, as today 13 Shaheds were fired at Kyiv in the morning and not a single one made it through. Also, a bit later in the day another batch of Shaheds were fired at Odesa, but all of those were intercepted as well, our AA is getting really good at shooting them down.
