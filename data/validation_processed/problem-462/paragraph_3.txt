But it probably explains why I don't remember anything in particular about him before the infamous "Wogan" appearance et al. I wasn't into sports as a kid in the 80s, so I wouldn't have been watching that sort of stuff anyway, but I do remember other sports presenters (e.g. Des Lynam, Dickie Davis, etc.) being more "personalities" whereas Icke was someone whose name and face I'd have recognised, but that was about it.
