That's supposed to be the idea but when you take a step back and look at the big picture you'll see that we have 1 major political party that has turned into a fascist regime and our wealth distribution at its worst point in our entire history. If that's not enough, then what is? It was only the other day when our government's leader were feeding us disinformation in regards to a deadly disease that has now killed over 1M Americans ffs. What more could it take?
