The proposal acknowledges that a move away from fossil fuels will be gradual and in line with national circumstances, hence the phrase "phase down" as against a phase out, and does not have any target date. It urges all countries to accelerate transition to clean energy and to acknowledge that all fossil fuels contribute to global warming, while recognising that the shift will have to consider national circumstances.
