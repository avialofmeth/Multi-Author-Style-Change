That's not how rights work. I don't give a shit about arms but no rights work that way. There was a whole important body of law, for example, about what restrictions were allowed on abortions and access when abortions were a right. That body of law grew absurdly inflated because anti abortion states tried every fucking imaginable thing they could to restrict access to abortions. By your interpretation of rights, abortions and almost any other right could be undermined easily. E.g. puting the only voting station in a state in one town that is extremely red or blue.
