Bukele is eroding the countryâ€™s democracy while doing this, so yes there are negatives going on. Several years ago, he forced the army into their legislature to force a vote a certain way. He has been limiting the power of the courts as well. Imprisoning without trial. But Salvadorans want a strong man to deal with the gangs, so they deal with it. This is also not a country known for democracy or human rights. They are still recovering from a civil war that lasted decades. The people want peace at any cost. I have family from there, and this is my understanding of how they feel about it.
