I wish the lawyer would have followed up his "same answer" with "For the record the deposed has answered that he pleads the fifth". It would take maybe 2-3 times before Trump would have perjured himself. (and I know the prosecutor was the one who recommended trump say "same answer" to speed things up. He had to speed things up because Trump's lawyers constructed a script that said I plead the fifth without actually saying those words, which made it multiple sentences of slow talking, small dick energy).
