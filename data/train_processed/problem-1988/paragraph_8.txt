I would oppose any militarized response to a direct attack on us here in America with equal vigor and would strongly urge everyone I know not to take up arms in her defense. Nations have no value, land has no value, their governments have no value, and none of them deserve any effort in their defense that could cost even one innocent life, ever. War never, ever serves the people, not even when it is defensive. It serves the state and the nation, both of which are meaningless things without value.
