Mediation is indeed, "a preliminary tool to avoid prolonged and unnecessary litigation." Mediation is simply a formalized negotiation process that's guided by a neutral mediator, typically an attorney who's acceptable to both parties. The mediator encourages but cannot compel agreement, and has no authority to make any judgment. If the contending parties can agree during mediation, costly litigation or arbitration are avoided.
