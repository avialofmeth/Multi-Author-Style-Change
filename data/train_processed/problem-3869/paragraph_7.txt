Communities who developed and are reliant on all those different man made reservoirs and water practices will all be undergoing some changes or if a smaller community, likely becoming a ghost towns as the cities and their millions need outweighs those small local town needs, foreign abuse of our laws and resources that really don't provide much in terms of their state's economies. Agriculture is a very minor contributor to most of these state's GDP's, 2% to 5% low. Locally for communities like Yuma, that's another story.
