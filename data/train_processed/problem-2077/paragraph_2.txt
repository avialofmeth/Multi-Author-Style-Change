What happened is that Cabral has been in preventive imprisonment for 6 years, and his attorneys argued that keeping him there for 6 years without an actual trial was unreasonable. The court accepted that argument. So, the main issue here is an ineffective system. That said, charges were not dropped, and he still faces sentences that add up to over 400 years in prison.
