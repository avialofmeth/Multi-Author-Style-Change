1) Pegasus can be installed on any phone, it doesn't require the user to click on a link. Many countries are using it. It allows complete access to all the information on the phone...location data, texts, photos, calls....and it can turn the phone into a remote listening device, flipping the mic on so that they can listen in on conversations.
