I told the detective that I’m sure we’ll be interviewed at some point in the future and have to try to explain what led up to some horrible thing he did. What I stated here is the very tip of the iceberg, there was so much that I eventually sat down and compiled a 6 page report of what I found in his phone, complete with screenshots to prove I wasn’t exaggerating or overreacting. I hoped it would get his mom to see how disturbed he is, but she never acknowledged it.
