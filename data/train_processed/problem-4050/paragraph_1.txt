Well the article doesn't mention it, but the impression is that NATO is trying to cover up that at least one was a russian missile, and the second was likely the ukrainian AA chasing it, because people have found out that coordinates for the strike match up with the presidential palace in Kyiv and an air field in Lviv, as if they were taken and mixed up. Furthermore, Ukrainian AA is supposed to self-destruct if it misses.
