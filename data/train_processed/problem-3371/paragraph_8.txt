A testament to medias failure politically is Trump and his appalling misdeeds as president. The deaths of thousands should be laid at his feet for validating lies, stifling the CDC and their professionals ability to lead, politicizing a deadly virus and simple precautions, etc. Media response to this and more have been, to be kind, weak.
