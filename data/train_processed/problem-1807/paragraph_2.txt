Not invasion but help the people. Or should we just keep letting them execute protesters? It’s like your angry that I’m angry that innocent people are dying. They are being killed for unjust reasons. Therefore, it makes sense to me to offer whatever help they feel they need. Be it military economic or political. What’s wrong with that? I’m not saying rule over them. I’m saying find out how we can assist them in ruling over themselves.
