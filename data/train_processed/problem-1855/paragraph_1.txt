My wife is a teacher and my god, the way some parents treat her is insane. The kid will get upset about something mundane and entirely classroom related (homework, told to stop doing something, etc) and they immediately message mom and dad. The parents then will call my wife's cell phone, call the school, email her, and have even shown up demanding to scream at her in person. Parents started Facebook groups because teachers my wife works with weren't forcing kids to recite the pledge of allegiance. These teachers were getting called out by their full names online.
