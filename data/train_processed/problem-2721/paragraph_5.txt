You’re welcome, also might I add that political power is gained and lost every decade or so in Saudi politics- so you might see one day MBS “decided to retire “ or “ disappeared “ and another rando appeared out of nowhere or a senior came to replace him. MBS is quite paranoid to the point that he searches his brothers when they come visit him.
