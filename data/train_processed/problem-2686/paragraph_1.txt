Twitter was in some serious debt when Musk bought them. And when he bought them he made it a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO). This put even more debt on Twitter and made it so that Twitter would have to pay off the purchase debt... which meant Twitter was now back to being cash poor. And unfortunately Musk hasn't been willing to pump any new money into the platform so they have to work with resources they have.
