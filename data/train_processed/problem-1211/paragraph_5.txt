No, it's quite the opposite. Since I have a gun and therefore can use overwhelming force to protect myself, I'm calmer and less fearful, meaning I'm less likely to scream and yell at people. And because I also know other people have guns, I'm also less likely to escalate the situation to the point where I may die.
