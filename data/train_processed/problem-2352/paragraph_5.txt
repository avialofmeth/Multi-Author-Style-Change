Damn right it is. I don’t understand how when I was in school in the 90’s we had a Black History course. We learned of the barbarity of slavery, we learned about Jim Crowe and the Civil Rights Movement. There were no objections from anybody and it was a very important part of our curriculum. Nowadays politicians want to hide the ugly side of our history because it makes them uncomfortable. This should not be. I hope DeSantis loses this case.
