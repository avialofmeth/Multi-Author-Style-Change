Hostels in Europe are cheap too, I stayed in London for a weekend for 120 total, and you can cook your own food at then so it's paying for groceries, not going out everyday, also the distance from Sweden to Germany is basically the difference of say New York to Florida driving (and flights being stupidly cheap in Europe, it's basically like taking a grey hound in terms of price, but much faster).
