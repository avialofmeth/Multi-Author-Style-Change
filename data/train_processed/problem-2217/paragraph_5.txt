This is just the conservative way of trying to control a womanâ€™s body, and what really irks me is all the women that are in favor of having their decisions about their lives decided for them. I have confidence that the voters of Kentucky will reject this garbage, but you never know, the folks in my state of residence are not known for making the most intelligent of decisions. I mean they keep electing McConnell and Paul, afterall.
